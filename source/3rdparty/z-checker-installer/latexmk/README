Latexmk, version 4.52c, 19 January 2017
---------------------------------------

Latexmk completely automates the process of generating a LaTeX
document.  Essentially, it is a highly specialized cousin of the
general make utility.  Given the source files for a document, latexmk
issues the appropriate sequence of commands to generate a .dvi, .ps,
.pdf or hardcopy version of the document, including repeated running
of the programs until cross references etc are resolved.  Latexmk can also
be set to run continuously with a previewer; the latex program, etc,
are rerun whenever one of the source files is modified.

Latexmk automatically determines file dependencies from the LaTeX .log
file.  It features: a fully reliable algorithm for deciding how many
times to run latex and related programs, automatic detection of
dependent files, the ability to generate pdf files using pdflatex or
via dvi or postscript files, and the continuous-preview mode.  For
bibliographies, the current version now supports biber as well as the
traditional bibtex.  Which of bibtex or biber to use is determined
automatically.

Please read the man page (or the corresponding text or postscript
file) for details of what latexmk does and what all the features are.
A copy of the fast help that can be seen by doing "latexmk -h" is at
the end of this file.

Latexmk is a perl script.  It is licensed under the GNU General Public
License v. 2.

It was modified by Evan McLean from the original script called "go"
written by David J. Musliner.  Now it is supported by

The start of the script file has copyright notices and disclaimers.  It
also has a modification history for those who are interested.

NOTES:-

1) See the INSTALL file for installation instructions

2) Portability under various UNIX-type systems (including Linux):
   A special hack is used at the beginning of the latexmk script to ensure
   that it correctly runs without the need to adjust a #! line.  All that
   is necessary is that the script has execute permission.

3) Portability under non-UNIX systems:
   Under other operating systems some other arrangement needs to be made
   to run the file.  For example under MS-Windows, the supplied batch file
   latexmk.bat will do this.  Under current TeXLive (2009 or later)
   distribution, latexmk can be installed by TeXLive's package
   manager, in which case an executable program is also installed to
   run latexmk.pl, and an appropriate version of Perl is part of the
   TeXLive system.  

   You may also find it necessary to convert files to the correct
   local format for text files.  As downloaded, the files are in UNIX
   format (line-ending is '\n').  On MS-Windows systems, the
   conversion to MSDOS format (with line-ending '\r\n') is normally
   UNnecessary, since much current software handles the UNIX format
   correctly.  (The known current software for which this statement
   applies includes MikTeX, TeXLive, emacs.)

4) Portability:  The various commands to process LaTeX files made need to
   be changed for particular installations.  See the INSTALL file and the
   documentation for information on customization.  

5) Portability: Users of different UNIX-like systems may have to change
   the "$pscmd" variable in their RC file if the -pvc option is to work
   perfectly.  Refer to $pscmd in the man page.

6) Latexmk can be downloaded from the author's site at
   http://www.personal.psu.edu/jcc8/latexmk/
   This site also includes previous versions, and sometimes newer
   versions under development.

7) Latexmk is archived on the CTAN tex archive --- see
   http://www.ctan.org/pkg/latexmk  

8) [If for some reason you need to find the obsolete version 2, it can
   also be found on CTAN, e.g., at
   http://mirror.ctan.org/obsolete/support/latexmk/]

In addition, latexmk recognizes many other options that are passed to
latex and/or pdflatex without interpretation by latexmk.  Run latexmk
with the option -showextraoptions to see a list of these
