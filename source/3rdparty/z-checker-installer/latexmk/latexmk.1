.SH NAME
latexmk \- generate LaTeX document
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B latexmk [options] [file ...] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Latexmk
completely automates the process of compiling a LaTeX document.
Essentially, it is like a specialized relative of the general
\fImake\fR utility, but one which determines dependencies
automatically and has some other very useful features.  In its basic
mode of operation \fIlatexmk\fR is given the name of the primary
source file for a document, and it issues the appropriate sequence of
commands to generate a .dvi, .ps, .pdf and/or hardcopy version of the
document.  
.PP
By default \fIlatexmk\fR will run the commands necessary to generate 
a .dvi file.
.PP
\fILatexmk\fR can also be set to run continuously with a suitable
previewer.  In that case the \fIlatex\fR program (or one of its
relatives), etc, are rerun whenever
one of the source files is modified, and the previewer automatically
updates the on-screen view of the compiled document.
.PP
\fILatexmk\fR determines which are the source files by examining the
log file.  (Optionally, it also examines the list of input and output
files generated by the \fB-recorder\fR option of modern versions of
\fIlatex\fR (and \fIpdflatex\fR, \fIxelatex\fR, \fIlualatex\fR, etc).
See the documentation for the \fB-recorder\fR option of \fIlatexmk\fR
below.)  When \fIlatexmk\fR is run, it examines properties of the
source files, and if any have been changed since the last document
generation, \fIlatexmk\fR will run the various LaTeX processing
programs as necessary.  In particular, it will repeat the run of
\fIlatex\fR (or a related program)) often enough to resolve all cross
references; depending on the macro packages used.  With some macro
packages and document classes, four, or even more, runs may be
needed. If necessary, \fIlatexmk\fR will also run \fIbibtex\fR,
\fIbiber\fR, and/or \fImakeindex\fR.  In addition, \fIlatexmk\fR can
be configured to generate other necessary files.  For example, from an
updated figure file it can automatically generate a file in
encapsulated postscript or another suitable format for reading by
LaTeX.
.PP
\fILatexmk\fR has two different previewing options.  With the simple
\fB-pv\fR option, a dvi, postscript or pdf previewer is automatically
run after generating the dvi, postscript or pdf version of the
document.  The type of file to view is selected according to
configuration settings and command line options.
.PP
The second previewing option is the powerful \fB-pvc\fR option
(mnemonic: "preview continuously").  In this case, \fIlatexmk\fR runs
continuously, regularly monitoring all the source files to see if any
have changed.  Every time a change is detected, \fIlatexmk\fR runs all
the programs necessary to generate a new version of the document.  A
good previewer will then automatically update its
display.  Thus the user can simply edit a file and, when the changes
are written to disk, \fIlatexmk\fR completely automates the cycle of
updating the .dvi (and/or the .ps and .pdf) file, and refreshing
the previewer's display.  It's not quite WYSIWYG, but usefully close.
.PP
For other previewers, the user may have to manually make the previewer
update its display, which can be (e.g., with some versions of \fIxdvi\fR and
\fIgsview\fR) as simple as forcing a redraw of its display.
.PP
\fILatexmk\fR has the ability to print a banner in gray diagonally
across each page when making the postscript file.  It can also, if
needed, call an external program to do other postprocessing on
generated dvi and postscript files.  (See the options \fB-dF\fR and
\fB-pF\fR, and the documentation for the \fI$dvi_filter\fR and
\fI$ps_filter\fR configuration variables.)  These capabilities are
leftover from older versions of \fIlatexmk\fR.  More flexibility can
be obtained in current versions, since the command strings for running
\fIlatex\fR, \fIpdflatex\fR, etc can now be configured to run multiple
commands. 
This also extends the possibility of postprocessing generated files.
.PP
\fILatexmk\fR is highly configurable, both from the command line and
in configuration files, so that it can accommodate a wide variety of
user needs and system configurations.  Default values are set
according to the operating system, so \fIlatexmk\fR often works 
without special configuration on MS-Windows, cygwin, Linux, OS-X, and
other UNIX systems.
.PP
A very annoying complication handled very reliably by \fIlatexmk\fR,
is that LaTeX is a multiple pass system.  On each run, LaTeX reads in
information generated on a previous run, for things like cross
referencing and indexing.  In the simplest cases, a second run of
LaTeX suffices, and often the log file contains a message about the
need for another pass.  However, there is a wide variety of add-on
macro packages to LaTeX, with a variety of behaviors.  The result is
to break simple-minded determinations of how many runs are needed and
of which programs.  \fILatexmk\fR has a highly
general and efficient solution to these issues.  The solution involves
retaining between runs information on the source files, and a symptom
is that \fIlatexmk\fR generates an extra file (with extension
\fI.fdb_latexmk\fR, by default) that contains the source file
information.

.SH LATEXMK OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS ON COMMAND LINE
In general the command line to invoke \fIlatexmk\fR has the form

	latexmk [options] [file]

All options can be introduced by single or double "-" characters,
e.g., "latexmk -help" or "latexmk --help".

\fBNote 1\fR: \fBIn addition to the options in the list below,
\fIlatexmk\fR recognizes almost all the options recognized by the
\fIlatex\fR, \fIpdflatex\fR programs (and their relatives) in their 
current TeXLive and MiKTeX implementations.  Some of the options for
these programs also trigger special action or behavior by
\fIlatexmk\fR, in which case they have specific explanations in this
document.  Otherwise, they 
are just passed through to a called \fIlatex\fR or \fIpdflatex\fR
program. Run \fIlatexmk\fR with the \fB-showextraoptions\fR to get a
list of the options that \fIlatexmk\fR accepts and that are simply
passed through to \fIlatex\fR or \fIpdflatex\fR (etc).  See also the
explanation of the \fB-showextraoptions\fR option for more
information.

\fBNote 2\fR: In this documentation, the program \fIpdflatex\fR is often
referred to.  Users of programs like \fIlualatex\fR and \fIxelatex\fR
should know that from \fIlatexmk\fR's point of view, these other
programs behave very like \fIpdflatex\fR, i.e., they make a pdf file from a
tex file, etc.  So whenever \fIpdflatex\fR is mentioned without
mention of the other programs, the statements apply equally to
\fIlualatex\fR, \fIxelatex\fR, and any other similar programs.
\fILatexmk\fR can be easily configured to use whichever of these
programs is needed.  See the documentation for the following options:
\fB-pdflua\fR, \fB-pdfxe\fR, \fB-lualatex\fR, and \fB-xelatex\fR,
and also see the documentation for the 
\fI$pdflatex\fR, \fI$lualatex\fR, and \fI$xelatex\fR configuration variables.
At present \fIlatexmk\fR does not do automatic detection of which
program is to be used.  
 

\fBDefinitions of options and arguments\fR

.TP
.B file
One or more files can be specified.  If no files are specified,
\fIlatexmk\fR will, by default, run on all files in the current working directory
with a ".tex" extension.  This behavior can be changed: see the
description concerning the \fI@default_files\fR variable in the
section "List of configuration variables usable in initialization
files". 

If a file is specified without an extension, then the ".tex" extension
is automatically added, just as LaTeX does.  Thus, if you specify:

	latexmk foo

then \fIlatexmk\fR will operate on the file "foo.tex".  

.TP
.B -auxdir=FOO or -aux-directory=FOO
Sets the directory for auxiliary output files of (pdf)latex 
(.aux, .log etc).  This
achieves its effect by the \fB-aux-directory\fR option of (pdf)latex,
which currently is only implemented on the MiKTeX version of
(pdf)latex.

See also the \fB-outdir\fR/\fB-output-directory\fR options, and the
\fI$aux_dir\fR, \fI$out_dir\fR, and \fI$search_path_separator\fR
configuration variables of \fIlatexmk\fR.  In particular, see the
documentation of \fI$out_dir\fR for some complications on what
directory names are suitable.

If you also use the \fB-cd\fR option, and the specified auxiliary output
directory is a relative path, then the path is interpreted relative to
the document directory.

.TP
.B -bibtex 
When the source file uses bbl files for bibliography, run bibtex or
biber as needed to regenerate the bbl files.  

This property can also be configured by setting the \fI$bibtex_use\fR
variable to 2 in a configuration file

.TP
.B -bibtex-
Never run bibtex or biber.  

A common use for this option is when a document comes from an external
source, complete with its bbl file(s), and the user does not have the
corresponding bib files available.  In this situation use of the
\fB-bibtex-\fR option will prevent \fIlatexmk\fR from trying to run
\fIbibtex\fR or \fIbiber\fR, which would result in overwriting of the
bbl files. 

.TP
.B -bibtex-cond
When the source file uses bbl file(s) for the bibliography, run
\fIbibtex\fR or \fIbiber\fR as needed to regenerate the bbl files, but
only if the 
relevant bib file(s) exist.  Thus when the bib files are not
available, \fIbibtex\fR or \fIbiber\fR is not run, thereby avoiding
overwriting of 
the bbl file(s).  This is the default setting.

(Note that it is possible for \fIlatexmk\fR to decide that the bib
file does not exist, even though the bib file does exist and
\fIbibtex\fR or \fIbiber\fR finds it.  The problem is that the bib
file may not be in 
the current directory but in some search path; the places
\fIlatexmk\fR and \fIbibtex\fR or \fIbiber\fR cause to be searched need not be
identical.  On modern installations of TeX and related programs this
problem should not arise, since \fIlatexmk\fR uses the \fIkpsewhich\fR
program to do the search, and \fIkpsewhich\fR should use the same
search path as \fIbibtex\fR and \fIbiber\fR.  If this problem arises, use the
\fB-bibtex\fR option when invoking \fIlatexmk\fR.)

.TP
.B -bm <message>
A banner message to print diagonally across each page when converting
the dvi file to postscript.  The message must be a single argument on
the command line so be careful with quoting spaces and such.

Note that if the \fB-bm\fR option is specified, the \fB-ps\fR option is
assumed.

.TP
.B -bi <intensity>
How dark to print the banner message.  A decimal number between 0 and 1.
0 is black and 1 is white.  The default is 0.95, which is OK unless your
toner cartridge is getting low.

.TP
.B -bs <scale>
A decimal number that specifies how large the banner message will be
printed.  Experimentation is necessary to get the right scale for your
message, as a rule of thumb the scale should be about equal to 1100
divided by the number of characters in the message.  The default is 220.0
which is just right for 5 character messages.

.TP 
.B -commands
List the commands used by \fIlatexmk\fR for processing files, and then
exit. 

.TP 
.B -c
Clean up (remove) all regeneratable files generated by \fIlatex\fR and
\fIbibtex\fR or \fIbiber\fR except dvi, postscript and pdf.  These files are a
combination of log files, aux files, \fIlatexmk\fR's database file of
source file information, 
and those with extensions
specified in the \fI@generated_exts\fR configuration variable.  In addition,
files specified by the \fI$clean_ext\fR configuration variable are
removed.  

This cleanup is instead of a regular make.  See the \fB-gg\fR option
if you want to do a cleanup then a make.

If \fI$bibtex_use\fR is set to 0 or 1, bbl files are counted as
non-regeneratable. 

If \fI$cleanup_includes_cusdep_generated\fR is nonzero, regeneratable
files are considered as including those generated by custom
dependencies and are also deleted.  Otherwise these files are not deleted.

.TP 
.B -C
Clean up (remove) all regeneratable files generated by \fIlatex\fR and
\fIbibtex\fR or \fIbiber\fR.  This is the same as the \fB-c\fR option with the
addition of dvi, postscript and pdf files, and those specified
in the \fI$clean_full_ext\fR configuration variable.

This cleanup is instead of a regular make.  See the \fB-gg\fR option
if you want to do a cleanup than a make.

If \fI$bibtex_use\fR is set to 0 or 1, bbl files are counted as
non-regeneratable. 

If \fI$cleanup_includes_cusdep_generated\fR is nonzero, regeneratable
files are considered as including those generated by custom
dependencies and are also deleted.  Otherwise these files are not deleted.

.TP 
.B -CA
(Obsolete).  Now equivalent to the \fB-C\fR option.  See that option
for details. 

.TP 
.B -cd
Change to the directory containing the main source file before processing
it.  Then all the generated files (aux, log, dvi, pdf, etc) will be
relative to the source file.  

This option is particularly useful when \fIlatexmk\fR is invoked from
a GUI configured to invoke \fIlatexmk\fR with a full pathname for the
source file.

.TP 
.B -cd-
Do NOT change to the directory containing the main source file before processing
it.  Then all the generated files (aux, log, dvi, pdf, etc) will be
relative to the current directory rather than the source file.  

This is the default behavior and corresponds to the behavior of the
\fIlatex\fR and \fIpdflatex\fR programs.  However, it is not desirable
behavior when \fIlatexmk\fR is invoked by a GUI configured to invoke
\fIlatexmk\fR with a full pathname for the source file.  See the
\fB-cd\fR option.

.TP 
.B -CF
Remove the file containing the database of source file information,
before doing the other actions requested.

.TP 
.B -d
Set draft mode.  This prints the banner message "DRAFT" across your
page when converting the dvi file to postscript.  Size and intensity
can be modified with the \fB-bs\fR and \fB-bi\fR options.  The \fB-bm\fR
option will override this option as this is really just a short way of
specifying:

	latexmk -bm DRAFT

Note that if the \fB-d\fR option is specified, the \fB-ps\fR option is
assumed.

.TP
.B -deps 
Show a list of dependent files after processing.  This is in the form
of a dependency list of the form used by the \fImake\fR program, and
it is therefore suitable for use in a Makefile.  It gives an overall
view of the files without listing intermediate files, as well as
\fIlatexmk\fR can determine them.

By default the list of dependent files is sent to stdout (i.e.,
normally to the screen unless you've redirected \fIlatexmk\fR's
output). But you can set the filename where the list is sent by the
\fB-deps-out=\fR option.

See the section "USING \fIlatexmk\fR WITH \fImake\fR" for
an example of how to use a dependency list with \fImake\fR.  

Users familiar with GNU \fIautomake\fR and \fIgcc\fR will find that
the \fB-deps\fR option is very similar in its purpose and results to
the \fB-M\fR option to \fIgcc\fR.  (In fact, \fIlatexmk\fR also has
options \fB-M\fR, \fB-MF\fR, and \fB-MP\fR options that behave like
those of \fIgcc\fR.)

.TP
.B -dependents
Equivalent to \fB-deps\fR.

.TP
.B -deps-  
Do not show a list of dependent files after processing.  (This is the
default.) 

.TP
.B -dependents-
Equivalent to \fB-deps-\fR.

.TP
.B -deps-out=FILENAME  
Set the filename to which the list of dependent files is written.  If
the FILENAME argument is omitted or set to "-", then the output is
sent to stdout. 

Use of this option also turns on the output of the list of dependent
files after processing.

.TP
.B -dF
Dvi file filtering.  The argument to this option is a filter which will
generate a filtered dvi file with the extension ".dviF".  All extra
processing (e.g. conversion to postscript, preview, printing) will then
be performed on this filtered dvi file.

Example usage: To use dviselect to select only the even pages of the dvi file:

	latexmk -dF "dviselect even" foo.tex

.TP
.B -diagnostics
Print detailed diagnostics during a run.  This may help for debugging
problems or to understand \fIlatexmk\fR's behavior in difficult
situations. 

.TP
.B -dvi
Generate dvi version of document.

.TP
.B -dvi-
Turn off generation of dvi version of document.  (This may get
overridden, if some other file is made (e.g., a .ps file) that is
generated from the dvi file, or if no generated file at all is
requested.) 

.TP
.B -e <code>
Execute the specified initialization code before processing.  The code
is \fIPerl\fR code of the same form as is used in \fIlatexmk\fR's
initialization files.  For more details,
see the information on the
\fB-r\fR option, and the section about "Configuration/initialization
(RC) files".  The code is typically a sequence of assignment
statements separated by semicolons.

The code is executed when the \fB-e\fR option is encountered during
\fIlatexmk\fR's parsing of its command line.  See the \fB-r\fR option
for a way of executing initialization code from a file.  An error
results in \fIlatexmk\fR stopping.  Multiple instances of the \fB-r\fR
and \fB-e\fR options can be used, and they are executed in the order
they appear on the command line.

Some care is needed to deal with proper quoting of special characters
in the code on the command line.  For example, suppose you want
to set the latex command to use its -shell-escape option, then under
UNIX/Linux you could use the line

	latexmk -e '$latex=q/latex %O -shell-escape %S/' file.tex

Note that the single quotes block normal UNIX/Linux command shells
from treating the characters inside the quotes as special.
(In this example, the q/.../ construct is a
\fIPerl\fR idiom equivalent to using 
single quotes.  This avoids the complications of getting a quote
character inside an already quoted string in a way that is independent
of both the shell and the operating-system.)

The above command line will NOT work under MS-Windows with cmd.exe or
command.com or 4nt.exe.  For MS-Windows with these command shells you
could use

	latexmk -e "$latex=q/latex %O -shell-escape %S/" file.tex

or

	latexmk -e "$latex='latex %O -shell-escape %S'" file.tex

The last two examples will NOT work with UNIX/Linux command shells.

(\fINote\fR: the above examples show are to show how to use the
\fB-e\fR to specify initialization code to be executed.  But the
particular effect can be achieved also by the use of the \fB-latex\fR
option with less problems in dealing with quoting.)

.TP
.B -f
Force \fIlatexmk\fR to continue document processing despite errors.
Normally, when \fIlatexmk\fR detects that LaTeX or another program has
found an error which will not be resolved by further processing, no
further processing is carried out.

Note: "Further processing" means the running of other programs or the
rerunning of \fIlatex\fR (etc) that would be done if no errors had
occurred.  If instead, or additionally, you want the \fIlatex\fR (etc)
program not to pause for user input after an error, you should arrange
this by an option that is passed to the program, e.g., by
\fIlatexmk\fR's option \fB-interaction=nonstopmode\fR.

.TP
.B -f-
Turn off the forced processing-past-errors such as is set by the
\fB-f\fR option.  This could be used to override a setting in a
configuration file.

.TP
.B -g
Force \fIlatexmk\fR to process document fully, even under situations
where \fIlatexmk\fR would normally decide that no changes in the
source files have occurred since the previous run. 
This option is useful, for example, if you change some options and
wish to reprocess the files.

.TP
.B -g-
Turn off \fB-g\fR.

.TP
.B -gg
"Super go mode" or "clean make": clean out generated files as if
\fB-C\fR had been given, and then do a regular make.

.TP
.B -h, -help
Print help information.

.TP
.B -jobname=STRING
Set the basename of output files(s) to STRING, instead of the default,
which is the basename of the specified TeX file.

This is like the same option for current implementations of the
\fIlatex\fR, \fIpdflatex\fR, etc, and the passing of this option to
these programs is part of \fIlatexmk\fR's implementation of
\fB-jobname\fR.

.TP
.B -l
Run in landscape mode, using the landscape mode for the previewers and
the dvi to postscript converters.  This option is not normally needed
nowadays, since current previewers normally determine this information
automatically. 

.TP
.B -l-
Turn off \fB-l\fR.

.TP
.B -latex="COMMAND"
This sets the string specifying the command to run latex, and is
typically used to add desired options.  Since the string normally
contains spaces, it should be quoted, e.g.,

     latexmk -latex="latex --shell-escape %O %S"  foo.tex

The specification of the contents of the string are the same as for
the \fI$latex\fR configuration variable.  Depending on your
operating system and the command-line shell you are using, you may
need to change the single quotes to double quotes (or something
else). 

To set the command for running \fIpdflatex\fR (rather than the command for
\fIlatex\fR) see the \fB-pdflatex\fR option.

.TP
.B -logfilewarninglist
.B -logfilewarnings
After a run of \fI(pdf)latex\fR, give a list of warnings about
undefined citations and references (unless silent mode is on).

See also the \fI$silence_logfile_warnings\fR configuration variable.

.TP
.B -logfilewarninglist-
.B -logfilewarnings-
After a run of \fI(pdf)latex\fR, do not give a list of warnings about
undefined citations and references.  (Default)

See also the \fI$silence_logfile_warnings\fR configuration variable.

.TP
.B -lualatex
Use \fIlualatex\fR.  That is, use \fIlualatex\fR to process the source file(s) to
pdf.  The generation of dvi and postscript files is turned off.

This option is equivalent to using the following set of options

     -pdflua -dvi- -ps-

(\fINote\fR: Note that the method of implementation of this option,
but not its intended effect, differ from some earlier versions of
\fIlatexmk\fR.)

.TP
.B -M
Show list of dependent files after processing.  This is equivalent to
the \fB-deps\fR option.

.TP
.B -MF file
If a list of dependents is made, the \fB-MF\fR specifies the file to
write it to. 

.TP
.B -MP
If a list of dependents is made, include a phony target for each source
file.  If you use the dependents list in a Makefile, the dummy rules
work around errors the program \fImake\fR gives if you remove header
files without updating the Makefile to match.

.TP
.B -new-viewer
When in continuous-preview mode, always start a new viewer to view the
generated file.  By default, \fIlatexmk\fR will, in continuous-preview
mode, test for a previously running previewer for the same file and
not start a new one if a previous previewer is running.  However, its
test sometimes fails (notably if there is an already-running previewer
that is viewing a file of the same name as the current file, but in a
different directory).  This option turns off the default behavior.

.TP
.B -new-viewer-
The inverse of the \fB-new-viewer\fR option.  It puts \fIlatexmk\fR
in its normal behavior that in preview-continuous mode it checks for
an already-running previewer.  

.TP
.B -nobibtex
Never run bibtex or biber.  Equivalent to the \fB-bibtex-\fR option.

.TP
.B -norc
Turn off the automatic reading of initialization (rc) files.

N.B. Normally the initialization files are read and obeyed, and then
command line options are obeyed in the order they are encountered.
But \fB-norc\fR is an exception to this rule: it is acted on first,
no matter where it occurs on the command line.

.TP
.B -outdir=FOO or -output-directory=FOO

Sets the directory for the output files of (pdf)latex.  This achieves
its effect by the \fB-output-directory\fR option of (pdf)latex, which
currently (Dec. 2011 and later) is implemented on the common versions of
(pdf)latex, i.e., MiKTeX and TeXLive.  It may not be present in other
versions. 

See also the \fB-auxdir\fR/\fB-aux-directory\fR options, and the
\fI$aux_dir\fR, \fI$out_dir\fR, and \fI$search_path_separator\fR
configuration variables of \fIlatexmk\fR.  In particular, see the
documentation of \fI$out_dir\fR for some complications on what
directory names are suitable.

If you also use the \fB-cd\fR option, and the specified output
directory is a relative path, then the path is interpreted relative to
the document directory.

.TP
.B -p
Print out the document.  By default the file to be printed is
the first in the list postscript, pdf, dvi that is being made.
But you can use the
\fB-print=...\fR option to change the type of file to be printed, and you
can configure this in a start up file (by setting the
\fI$print_type\fR variable).  

However, printing is enabled by default only under UNIX/Linux systems,
where the default is to use the lpr command and only on postscript
files.  In general, the correct
behavior for printing very much depends on your system's software.  In
particular, under MS-Windows you must have suitable program(s)
available, and you must have configured the print commands used by
\fIlatexmk\fR.  This can be non-trivial.  See the documentation on the
\fI$lpr\fR, \fI$lpr_dvi\fR, and \fI$lpr_pdf\fR configuration variables
to see how to set the commands for printing.

This option is incompatible with the \fB-pv\fR and \fB-pvc\fR options,
so it turns them off. 

.TP
.B -pdf
Generate pdf version of document using \fIpdflatex\fR.  (If you wish
to use \fIlualatex\fR or \fIxelatex\fR, you can use whichever of the
options \fB-pdflua\fR, \fB-pdfxe\fR, \fB-lualatex\fR or \fB-xelatex\fR
applies.)  To configure 
\fIlatexmk\fR to have such behavior by default, see the section on 
"Configuration/initialization (rc) files".

.TP
.B -pdfdvi
Generate pdf version of document from the dvi file, by default using dvipdf.

.TP
.B -pdflua
Generate pdf version of document using \fIlualatex\fR.

.TP
.B -pdfps
Generate pdf version of document from the ps file, by default using
\fIps2pdf\fR. 

.TP
.B -pdfxe
Generate pdf version of document using \fIxelatex\fR.  Note that to
optimize processing time, \fIlatexmk\fR uses \fIxelatex\fR to generate
an xdv file rather than a pdf file directly.  Only after possibly
multiple runs to generate a fully up-to-date xdv does \fIlatexmk\fR
then call \fIxdvipdfmx\fR to generate the final pdf file.

(\fINote:\fR When the document includes large graphics files,
especially png files, the last step can be quite time consuming, even
when the creation of the xdv file by \fIxelatex\fR is fast.  So the
use of the intermediate xdv file can result in substantial gains in
procesing time, since the pdf file is produced once rather than on
every run of \fIxelatex\fR.)

.TP
.B -pdf-
Turn off generation of pdf version of document.  
(This can be used to override a setting in a configuration file.
It may get overridden if some other option requires the generation of
a pdf file.)

.TP
.B -pdflatex="COMMAND"
This sets the string specifying the command to run \fIpdflatex\fR, and is
typically used to add desired options.  Since the string normally
contains spaces, it should be quoted, e.g.,

     latexmk -pdf -pdflatex="pdflatex --shell-escape %O %S"  foo.tex

The specification of the contents of the string are the same as for
the \fI$pdflatex\fR configuration variable.  Depending on your
operating system and the command-line shell you are using, you may
need to change the single quotes to double quotes (or something
else). 

To set the command for running \fIlatex\fR (rather than the command
for \fIpdflatex\fR) see the \fB-latex\fR option.

.TP
.B -print=dvi, -print=ps, -print=pdf, -print=auto,
Define which kind of file is printed.  This option also ensures that
the requisite file is made, and turns on printing.

The (default) case
\fB-print=auto\fR determines the kind of print file automatically from
the set of files that is being made.  The first in the list
postscript, pdf, dvi that is among the files to be made is the one
used for print out.

.TP
.B -ps
Generate postscript version of document.

.TP
.B -ps-
Turn off generation of postscript version of document.
This can be used to override a setting in a configuration file.
(It may get overridden by some other option that requires a postscript
file, for example a request for printing.)

.TP
.B -pF
Postscript file filtering.  The argument to this option is a filter
which will generate a filtered postscript file with the extension
".psF".  All extra processing (e.g. preview, printing) will then be
performed on this filtered postscript file.

Example of usage: Use psnup to print two pages on the one page:

	latexmk -ps -pF 'psnup -2' foo.tex

or

	latexmk -ps -pF "psnup -2" foo.tex

Whether to use single or double quotes round the "psnup -2" will
depend on your command interpreter, as used by the particular version
of perl and the operating system on your computer.

.TP
.B -pv
Run file previewer.  If the \fB-view\fR option is used, this will select
the kind of file to be previewed (dvi, ps or pdf).
Otherwise the viewer views the "highest" kind of file selected, by the
\fB-dvi\fR, \fB-ps\fR, \fB-pdf\fR, \fB-pdfps\fR options, in the
order dvi, ps, pdf (low to high).
If no file type has been selected, the dvi previewer will be used.
This option is incompatible with the \fB-p\fR and \fB-pvc\fR options,
so it turns them off.

.TP
.B -pv-
Turn off \fB-pv\fR.

.TP
.B -pvc
Run a file previewer and continually update the .dvi, .ps, and/or .pdf
files whenever changes are made to source files (see the Description
above).  Which of these files is generated and which is viewed is
governed by the other options, and is the same as for the \fB-pv\fR
option. 
The preview-continuous option \fB-pvc\fR can only work with one file.
So in this case you will normally only specify one filename on
the command line.  It is also incompatible with the 
\fB-p\fR and \fB-pv\fR options, so it turns these options off.

The \fB-pvc\fR option also turns off force mode (\fB-f\fR), as is
normally best for continuous preview mode.  If you really want force
mode, use the options in the order \fB-pvc -f\fR.

With a good previewer the display will be automatically updated.
(Under \fIsome but not all\fR versions of UNIX/Linux "gv -watch" does
this for postscript files; this can be set by a configuration
variable.  This would also work for pdf files except for an apparent
bug in gv that causes an error when the newly updated pdf file is
read.)  Many other previewers will need a manual update.

\fBImportant note\fR: the acroread program on MS-Windows locks the pdf file,
and prevents new versions being written, so it is a bad idea to use
acroread to view pdf files in preview-continuous mode.  
It is better to use a different viewer: \fISumatraPDF\fR and
\fIgsview\fR are good possibilities. 

There are some other methods for arranging an update, notably useful
for many versions of \fIxdvi\fR and \fIxpdf\fR.  These are best set in
\fIlatexmk\fR's configuration; see below. 

Note that if \fIlatexmk\fR dies or is stopped by the user, the
"forked" previewer will continue to run.  Successive invocations with
the \fB-pvc\fR option will not fork new previewers, but \fIlatexmk\fR
will normally use the existing previewer.  (At least this will happen
when \fIlatexmk\fR is running under an operating system where it knows
how to determine whether an existing previewer is running.)

.TP
.B -pvc-
Turn off \fB-pvc\fR.

.TP
.B -quiet
Same as -silent

.TP
.B -r <rcfile>
Read the specified initialization file ("RC file") before processing.

Be careful about the ordering: (1) Standard initialization files --
see the section below on "Configuration/initialization (RC) files" --
are read first.  (2) Then the options on the command line are acted on
in the order they are given.  Therefore if an initialization file is
specified by the \fB-r\fR option, it is read during this second step.
Thus an initialization file specified with the \fB-r\fR option can
override both the standard initialization files and \fIpreviously\fR
specified options.  But all of these can be overridden by \fIlater\fR
options.

The contents of the RC file just comprise a piece of code in the
\fIPerl\fR programming language
(typically a sequence of assignment statements); they are executed
when the \fB-r\fR option is encountered during \fIlatexmk\fR's parsing
of its command line.  See the \fB-e\fR option for a way of giving
initialization code directly on \fIlatexmk\fR's command line.  An
error results in \fIlatexmk\fR stopping.  Multiple instances of the
\fB-r\fR and \fB-e\fR options can be used, and they are executed in
the order they appear on the command line.

.TP
.B -recorder
Give the -recorder option with \fIlatex\fR and \fIpdflatex\fR.  In
(most) modern versions of these programs, this results in a file of
extension \fI.fls\fR containing a list of the files that these
programs have read and written.  \fILatexmk\fR will then use this file
to improve its detection of source files and generated files after a
run of \fIlatex\fR or \fIpdflatex\fR.  This is the default setting of
\fIlatexmk\fR, unless overridden in an initialization file.

For further information, see the documentation for the \fI$recorder\fR
configuration variable.

.TP
.B -recorder-
Do not supply the -recorder option with \fIlatex\fR and \fIpdflatex\fR.

.TP
.B -rules 
Show a list of \fIlatemk\fR's rules and dependencies after processing.

.TP
.B -rules-  
Do not show a list of \fIlatexmk\fR's rules and dependencies after
processing.  (This is the default.)

.TP
.B -showextraoptions
Show the list of extra \fIlatex\fR and \fIpdflatex\fR options that
\fIlatexmk\fR recognizes, but that it simply passes
through to the programs \fIlatex\fR, \fIpdflatex\fR, etc  when they
are run.  These options are 
(currently) a combination of those allowed by the TeXLive and MiKTeX
implementations.  (If a particular option is given to \fIlatexmk\fR
but is not handled by the particular implementation of \fIlatex\fR or
\fIpdflatex\fR that is being used, that program will probably give an
error message.)  These options are very numerous, but are not listed
in this documentation because they have no effect on \fIlatexmk\fR's
actions.

There are a few options (\fB-includedirectory=dir\fR,
\fB-initialize\fR, \fB-ini\fR) that are not recognized, either because
they don't fit with \fIlatexmk\fR's intended operations, or because
they need special processing by \fIlatexmk\fR that isn't implemented
(at least, not yet).

There are also options that are accepted by \fIlatex\fR etc, but
instead trigger actions by \fIlatexmk\fR: \fB-help\fR,
\fB-version\fR. 

Finally, there are certain options for \fIlatex\fR and \fIpdflatex\fR
(e.g., \fB-recorder\fR) that trigger special actions or behavior by
\fIlatexmk\fR itself as well as being passed in some form to the
called \fIlatex\fR and \fIpdflatex\fR program, or that affect other
programs as well.  These options do have entries in this
documentation.  These options are:
\fB-jobname=STRING\fR, \fB-aux-directory=dir\fR,
\fB-output-directory=DIR\fR, \fB-quiet\fR, and \fB-recorder\fR.

.TP
.B -silent
Run commands silently, i.e., with options that reduce the amount of
diagnostics generated.  For example, with the default settings, the
command "latex -interaction=batchmode" is used for \fI(pdf)latex\fR
and friends.

See also the \fB-logfilewarninglist\fR and \fB-logfilewarninglist-\fR
options. 

Also reduce the number of informational messages that \fIlatexmk\fR
itself generates. 

To change the options used to make the commands run silently, you need
to configure \fIlatexmk\fR with changed values of its configuration
variables, the relevant ones being \fI$bibtex_silent_switch\fR,
\fI$biber_silent_switch\fR, \fI$dvipdf_silent_switch\fR, 
\fI$dvips_silent_switch\fR, \fI$latex_silent_switch\fR,
\fI$lualatex_silent_switch\fR
\fI$makeindex_silent_switch\fR, \fI$pdflatex_silent_switch\fR,
and \fI$xelatex_silent_switch\fR

.TP
.B -time
Show CPU time used.
See also the configuration variable \fI$show_time\fR.

.TP
.B -time-
Do not show CPU time used.
See also the configuration variable \fI$show_time\fR.

.TP
.B -use-make
When after a run of \fIlatex\fR or \fIpdflatex\fR, there are warnings
about missing files (e.g., as requested by the LaTeX \\input, \\include,
and \\includgraphics commands), \fIlatexmk\fR tries to make them by a custom
dependency. If no relevant custom dependency with an appropriate
source file is found, and if the \fB-use-make\fR option is set, then
as a last resort \fIlatexmk\fR will try to use the \fImake\fR program
to try to make the missing files.

Note that the filename may be specified without an extension, e.g.,
by \\includegraphics{drawing} in a LaTeX file.  In that case,
\fIlatexmk\fR will try making drawing.ext with ext set in turn to the
possible extensions that are relevant for \fIlatex\fR (or as
appropriate \fIpdflatex\fR).  

See also the documentation for the \fI$use_make_for_missing_files\fR
configuration variable. 

.TP
.B -use-make-
Do not use the make program to try to make missing files.  (Default.)

.TP
.B -v, -version
Print version number of \fIlatexmk\fR.

.TP
.B -verbose
Opposite of \fB-silent\fR.  This is the default setting.

.TP
.B -view=default, -view=dvi, -view=ps, -view=pdf, -view=none
Set the kind of file used when previewing is requested (e.g., by the
\fB-pv\fR or \fB-pvc\fR switches).  The default is to view the "highest"
kind of requested file (in the low-to-high order dvi, ps, pdf).  

Note the possibility \fB-view=none\fR where no viewer is opened at
all.  One example of is use is in conjunction with the \fB-pvc\fR
option, when you want \fIlatexmk\fR to do a compilation automatically
whenever source file(s) change, but do not want a previewer to be opened.

.TP
.B -xelatex
Use \fIxelatex\fR.  That is, use \fIxelatex\fR to process the source file(s) to
pdf.  The generation of dvi and postscript files is turned off.

This option is equivalent to using the following set of options

     -pdfxe -dvi- -ps-

[\fINote\fR: Note that the method of implementation of this option,
but not its intended primary effect, differ from some earlier versions
of \fIlatexmk\fR. \fILatexmk\fR first uses \fIxelatex\fR to make an
xdv file, and does all the extra runs needed (including those of
\fIbibtex\fR, etc).  Only after that does it make the pdf file from
the xdv file, using \fIxdvipdfmx\fR.  This procedure can result in
considerable savings in run time, since the xdv-to-pdf conversion is
quite time-consuming when large graphics files are used in the
document.]


.PP
\fBCompatibility between options\fR

The preview-continuous option \fB-pvc\fR can only work with one file.
So in this case you will normally only specify one filename on
the command line.  
.PP
Options \fB-p\fR, \fB-pv\fR and \fB-pvc\fR are mutually exclusive.  So
each of these options turns the others off.

.SH EXAMPLES

.SH DEALING WITH ERRORS, PROBLEMS, ETC

.PP
Some possibilities:

a. If you get a strange error, do look carefully at the output that is
on the screen and in log files.  While there is much that is
notoriously verbose in the output of \fIlatex\fR (and that is added to
by \fIlatexmk\fR), the verbosity is there for a reason: to enable the
user to diagnose problems.  \fILatexmk\fR does repeat some messages at
the end of a run that it thinks would otherwise be easy to miss in the
middle of other output. 

b. Generally, remember that \fIlatexmk\fR does its work by running
other programs.  Your first priority in dealing with errors should be
to examine what went wrong with the individual programs.  Then you
need to correct the causes of errors in the runs of these programs.
(Often these come from errors in the source document, but they could
also be about missing LaTeX packages, etc.)

c. If \fIlatexmk\fR doesn't run the programs the way you would like,
then you need to look in this documentation at the list of command
line options and then at the sections on configuration/initialization
files.  A lot of \fIlatexmk\fR's behavior is configurable to deal with
particular situations.  (But there is a lot of reading!)

\fIThe remainder of these notes consists of ideas for dealing with more
difficult situations.\fR

d. Further tricks can involve replacing the standard commands that
\fIlatexmk\fR runs by other commands or scripts.

e. For possible examples of code for use in an RC file, see the
directory example_rcfiles in the distribution of \fIlatexmk\fR (e.g.,
at http://mirror.ctan.org/support/latexmk/example_rcfiles).
Even if these examples don't do what you want, they may provide
suitable inspiration.

f. There's a useful trick that can be used when you use \fIlualatex\fR
instead of \fIpdflatex\fR (and in some related situations).  The
problem is that \fIlatexmk\fR won't notice a dependency on a file,
bar.baz say, that is input by the lua code in your document instead of
by the LaTeX part.  (Thus if you change bar.baz and rerun
\fIlatexmk\fR, then \fIlatexmk\fR will think no files have changed and
not rerun \fIlualatex\fR, whereas if you had '\\input{bar.baz}' in the
LaTeX part of the document, \fIlatexmk\fR would notice the change.)
One solution is just to put the following somewhere in the LaTeX part
of the document:

              \\typeout{(bar.baz)}

This puts a line in the log file that \fIlatexmk\fR will treat as
implying that the file bar.baz was read.  (At present I don't know a
way of doing this automatically.)  Of course, if the file has a
different name, change bar.baz to the name of your file.

g. See also the section \fBADVANCED CONFIGURATION: Some extra resources\fR.

.SH CONFIGURATION/INITIALIZATION (RC) FILES
.PP
\fILatexmk\fR can be customized using initialization files, which are
read at startup in the following order:
.PP
1) The system RC file, if it exists.  
   On a UNIX system, \fIlatexmk\fR searches for following places for its
system RC file, in the following order, and reads the first it finds:
   "/opt/local/share/latexmk/LatexMk",
   "/usr/local/share/latexmk/LatexMk",
   "/usr/local/lib/latexmk/LatexMk".
   On a MS-Windows system it looks for "C:\\latexmk\\LatexMk".
   On a cygwin system (i.e., a MS-Windows system in which Perl is
that of cygwin), \fIlatexmk\fR reads the first it finds of
   "/cygdrive/c/latexmk/LatexMk",
   "/opt/local/share/latexmk/LatexMk",
   "/usr/local/share/latexmk/LatexMk",
   "/usr/local/lib/latexmk/LatexMk".
   
In addition, it then tries the same set of locations, but with the
file name replaced "LatexMk" replaced by "latexmkrc". 
.PP
2) The user's RC file, if it exists.  This can be in one of two
places.  The traditional one is ".latexmkrc" in the user's home
directory.  The other possibility is "latexmk/latexmkrc" in the user's
XDG configuration home directory.  The actual file read is the first
of "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/latexmk/latexmkrc" or "$HOME/.latexmkrc" which
exists.  (See
https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html
for details on the XDG Base Directory Specification.)

Here $HOME
is the user's home directory.  [\fILatexmk\fR determines the user's
home directory as follows:  It is the value of the environment variable
HOME, if this variable exists, which normally is the case on UNIX-like
systems (including Linux and OS-X).  Otherwise the environment
variable USERPROFILE is used, if it exists, which normally is the case
on MS-Windows systems. Otherwise a blank string is used instead of
$HOME, in which case \fIlatexmk\fR does not look for an RC file in
it.]

$XDG_CONFIG_HOME is the value of the environment variable
XDG_CONFIG_HOME if it exists.  If this environment variable does not
exist, but $HOME is non-blank, then $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set to the
default value of $HOME/.config.  Otherwise $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is blank,
and \fIlatexmk\fR does not look for an RC file under it.

.PP
3) The RC file in the current working directory.  This file can be
named either "latexmkrc" or ".latexmkrc", and the first of these to be
found is used, if any.
.PP
4) Any RC file(s) specified on the command line with the \fB-r\fR
option.
.PP
Each RC file is a sequence of \fIPerl\fR commands.  Naturally, a user can use
this in creative ways.  But for most purposes, one simply uses a
sequence of assignment statements that override some of the built-in
settings of \fILatexmk\fR.  Straightforward cases can be handled
without knowledge of the \fIPerl\fR language by using the examples in this
document as templates.  Comment lines are introduced by the "#"
character.

Note that command line options are obeyed in the order in which
they are written; thus any RC file specified on the command line with
the \fB-r\fR option can override previous options but can be itself
overridden by later options on the command line.  There is also the
\fB-e\fR option, which allows initialization code to be specified in
\fIlatexmk\fR's command line.

\fI
For possible examples of code for in an RC file, see the directory
example_rcfiles in the distribution of \fIlatexmk\fR (e.g., at
http://mirror.ctan.org/support/latexmk/example_rcfiles).
\fR

.SH HOW TO SET VARIABLES IN INITIALIZATION FILES
.PP
The important variables that can be configured are described in the
section "List of configuration variables usable in initialization
files".  Syntax for setting these variables is of the following forms:
.PP
	$bibtex = 'bibtex %O %B';
.PP
for the setting of a string variable, 
.PP
	$preview_mode = 1;
.PP
for the setting of a numeric variable, and
.PP
	@default_files = ('paper', 'paper1');
.PP
for the setting of an array of strings.  It is possible to append an
item to an array variable as follows:

	push @default_files, 'paper2';

Note that simple "scalar" variables have names that begin with a $
character and array variables have names that begin with a @
character. Each statement ends with a semicolon.

Strings should be enclosed in single quotes.  (You could use double
quotes, as in many programming languages.  But then the \fIPerl\fR
programming language brings into play some special rules for
interpolating variables into strings.  People not fluent in \fIPerl\fR
will want to avoid these complications.)

You can do much more complicated things, but for this you will need to
consult a manual for the \fIPerl\fR programming language.  



.SH FORMAT OF COMMAND SPECIFICATIONS

Some of the variables set the commands that \fIlatexmk\fR uses for
carrying out its work, for example to generate a dvi file from a tex
file or to view a postscript file.  This section describes some
important features of how the commands are specified.
(Note\ that some of the possibilities listed here do not apply to
the \fI$kpsewhich\fR variable; see its documentation.)

\fBPlaceholders\fR:  Supposed you wanted \fIlatexmk\fR to use the
command elatex in place of the regular latex command, and suppose
moreover that you wanted to give it the option "--shell-escape".  You
could do this by the following setting:
.PP
     $latex = 'elatex --shell-escape %O %S';
.PP
The two items starting with the % character are placeholders.  These
are substituted by appropriate values before the command is run.  Thus
%S will be replaced by the source file that elatex will be applied to,
and %O will be replaced by any options that \fIlatexmk\fR has decided
to use for this command.  (E.g., if you used the \fB-silent\fR option in the
invocation of \fIlatexmk\fR,  it results in the replacement of %O by
"-interaction=batchmode".) 

The available placeholders are:
.TP
.B %B
base of filename for current command.  E.g., if a postscript file
document.ps is being made from the dvi file document.dvi, then the
basename is document.
.TP
.B %D
destination file (e.g., the name of the postscript file when
converting a dvi file to postscript).
.TP
.B %O
options
.TP
.B %R
root filename.  This is the base name for the main tex file.  
.TP
.B %S
source file (e.g., the name of the dvi file when converting a dvi file
to ps).
.TP
.B %T
The name of the primary tex file.
.TP
.B %Y
Name of directory for auxiliary output files (see the configuration
variable \fI$aux_dir\fR).  A directory separation character ('/') is
appended if \fI$aux_dir\fR is non-empty and does not end in a suitable
character, with suitable characters being those appropriate to UNIX
and MS-Windows, i.e., ':', '/' and '\\'.   Note that if after
initialization,  \fI$out_dir\fR is set, but \fI$aux_dir\fR is not set
(i.e., it is blank), then \fIlatexmk\fR sets \fI$aux_dir\fR to the
same value \fI$out_dir\fR. 
.TP
.B %Z
Name of directory for output files (see the configuration
variable \fI$out_dir\fR).  A directory separation character ('/') is
appended if \fI$out_dir\fR is non-empty and does not end in a suitable
character, with suitable characters being those appropriate to UNIX
and MS-Windows, i.e., ':', '/' and '\\'. 
.PP
If for some reason you need a literal % character in your string not
subject to the above rules, use "%%".
.PP
Appropriate quoting will be applied to the filename substitutions, so
you mustn't supply them yourself even if the names of your files have
spaces in them.  (But if your TeX filenames have spaces in them,
beware that many versions of the TeX program cannot correctly handle
filenames containing spaces.)  In case \fIlatexmk\fR's quoting does not work
correctly on your system, you can turn it off -- see the documentation
for the variable \fI$quote_filenames\fR.
.PP
The distinction between %B and %R needs a bit of care, since they are
often the same, but not always.  For example on a simple document, the
basename of a bibtex run is the same as for the texfile.  But in a
document with several bibliographies, the bibliography files will have
a variety of names.  Since bibtex is invoked with the basename of the
bibliography file, the setting for the bibtex command should therefore
be 
.PP
     $bibtex = 'bibtex %O %B';
.PP
Generally, you should use %B rather than %R.  Similarly for most
purposes, the name %T of the primary texfile is not a useful
placeholder.

See the default values in the section "List of configuration variables
usable in initialization files" for what is normally the most
appropriate usage. 

If you omit to supply any placeholders whatever in the specification
of a command, \fIlatexmk\fR will supply what its author thinks are
appropriate defaults.  This gives compatibility with configuration
files for previous versions of \fIlatexmk\fR, which didn't use
placeholders.

\fB"Detaching" a command\fR: Normally when \fIlatexmk\fR runs a
command, it waits for the command to run to completion.  This is
appropriate for commands like latex, of course.  But for previewers,
the command should normally run detached, so that \fIlatexmk\fR gets
the previewer running and then returns to its next task (or exits if
there is nothing else to do).  To achieve this effect of detaching a
command, you need to precede the command name with "start ", as in
.PP
     $dvi_previewer = 'start xdvi %O %S';
.PP
This will be translated to whatever is appropriate for your operating
system.

Notes: (1) In some circumstances, \fIlatexmk\fR will always run a
command detached.  This is the case for a previewer in preview
continuous mode, since otherwise previewing continuously makes no
sense.  (2) This precludes the possibility of running a command named
start.  (3) If the word start occurs more than once at the beginning
of the command string, that is equivalent to having just one.  (4)
Under cygwin, some complications happen, since cygwin amounts to a
complicated merging of UNIX and MS-Windows.  See the source code for
how I've handled the problem.

\fBCommand names containing spaces\fR: Under MS-Windows it is common
that the name of a command includes spaces, since software is often
installed in a subdirectory of "C:\\Program Files".  Such command names
should be enclosed in double quotes, as in
.PP
     $lpr_pdf = '"c:/Program Files/Ghostgum/gsview/gsview32.exe" /p %S';
     $pdf_previewer = 'start "c:/Program Files/SumatraPDF/SumatraPDF.exe" %O %S';
     $pdf_previewer = 'start "c:/Program Files/SumatraPDF (x86)/SumatraPDF.exe" %O %S';

.PP
(Note about the above example: Under MS-Windows forward slashes are
equivalent to backslashes in a filename under almost all circumstances,
provided that the filename 
is inside double quotes.  It is easier to use forward slashes in
examples like the one above, since then one does not have to worry
about the rules for dealing with forward slashes in strings in the
Perl language.)

\fBCommand names under Cygwin\fR: If \fIlatexmk\fR is executed by Cygwin's
Perl, \fI be particularly certain that pathnames in commands have
\fBforward\fI slashes\fR not the usual backslashes for the separator
of pathname components.  See the above examples.  Backslashes often
get misinterpreted by the Unix shell used by Cygwin's Perl to execute
external commands.  Forward slashes don't suffer from this problem,
and (when quoted, as above) are equally acceptable to MS-Windows.

\fBUsing MS-Windows file associations\fR: A useful trick under modern
versions of MS-Windows (e.g., WinXP) is to use just the 
command 'start' by itself:
.PP
     $dvi_previewer = 'start %S';
.PP
Under MS-Windows, this will cause to be run
whatever program the system has associated with dvi files.  (The same
applies for a postscript viewer and a pdf viewer.)  But note that this
trick is not always suitable for the pdf previwer, if your system has
acroread for the default pdf viewer.  As explained elsewhere, acroread
under MS-Windows does not work well with \fIlatex\fR and
\fIlatexmk\fR, because acroread locks the pdf file.

\fBNot using a certain command\fR: If a command is not to be run, the
command name NONE is used, as in
.PP
     $lpr  = 'NONE lpr';
.PP
This typically is used when an appropriate command does not exist on
your system.  The string after the "NONE" is effectively a comment.

\fBOptions to commands\fR:
Setting the name of a command can be used not only for changing the
name of the command called, but also to add options to command.
Suppose you want \fIlatexmk\fR to use latex with source specials
enabled.  Then you might use the following line in an initialization
file:
.PP
     $latex = 'latex --src-specials %O %S';
.PP

\fBRunning a subroutine instead of an external command\fR: Use a
specification starting with "internal", as in 
.PP
     $latex = 'internal mylatex %O %S';
     sub mylatex {
         my @args = @_;
         # Possible preprocessing here
         return system 'latex', @args;
     }
.PP
For some of the more exotic possibilities that then become available,
see the section "ADVANCED CONFIGURATION: Some extra resources and
advanced tricks". Also see some of the examples in the directory
\fIexample_rcfiles\fR in the \fIlatexmk\fR distribution.

\fBAdvanced tricks\fR: Normally one specifies a single command for the
commands invoked by \fIlatexmk\fR.  Naturally, if there is some
complicated additional processing you need to do in your special
situation, you can write a script (or batch file) to do the
processing, and then configure \fIlatexmk\fR to use your script in
place of the standard program.

You can also use a Perl subroutine instead of a script -- see above.
This is generally the most flexible and portable solution.

It is also possible to configure \fIlatexmk\fR to run multiple
commands.  For example, if when running \fIpdflatex\fR to generate a pdf
file from a tex file you need to run another program after \fIpdflatex\fR to
perform some extra processing, you could do something like:

     $pdflatex = 'pdflatex --shell-escape %O %S; pst2pdf_for_latexmk %B';

This definition assumes you are using a UNIX-like system (which
includes Linux and OS-X), so that the
two commands to be run are separated by the semicolon in the middle of
the string.

If you are using MS-Windows, you would replace the above line by 

   $pdflatex = 'cmd /c pdflatex --shell-escape %O %S'
               . '&& pst2pdf_for_latexmk %B';

Here, the UNIX command separator ; is replaced by &&.  In addition,
there is a problem that some versions of \fIPerl\fR on MS-Windows do
not obey the command separator; this problem is overcome by explicitly
invoking the MS-Windows command-line processor \fIcmd.exe\fR.

.SH LIST OF CONFIGURATION VARIABLES USABLE IN INITIALIZATION FILES
.PP
Default values are indicated in brackets.
.TP
.B $always_view_file_via_temporary [0]
Whether ps and pdf files are initially to be made in a temporary
directory and then moved to the final location.  (This applies to
\fIdvips\fR, \fIdvipdf\fR, and \fIps2pdf\fR operations, and the
filtering operators on dvi and ps files.  It does not apply to
\fIpdflatex\fR, unfortunately, since \fIpdflatex\fR provides no way of
specifying a chosen name for the output file.)

This use of a temporary file solves a problem that the making of these
files can occupy a substantial time.  If a viewer (notably \fIgv\fR)
sees that the file has changed, it may read the new file before
the program writing the file has not yet finished its work, which  can
cause havoc.

See the \fI$pvc_view_file_via_temporary\fR variable for a setting that
applies only if preview-continuous mode (-pvc option) is used.  See
\fI$tmpdir\fR for the setting of the directory where the temporary
file is created. 

.TP
.B $auto_rc_use [1]
Whether to automatically read the standard initialization (rc) files,
which are the system RC file, the user's RC file, and the RC file in
the current directory.  The command line option \fB-norc\fR can be
used to turn this setting off.  Each RC file could also turn this
setting off, i.e., it could set \fI$auto_rc_use\fR to zero to prevent
automatic reading of the later RC files.

This variable does not affect the reading of RC files specified on the
command line by the \fB-r\fR option.

.TP
.B $aux_dir [""]
The directory in which auxiliary files (aux, log, etc) are to be
written by a run of (pdf)latex.  If this variable is not set, but 
\fI$out_dir\fR is set, then \fI$aux_dir\fR is set to \fI$out_dir\fR,
which is the directory to which general output files are to be
written. 

\fBImportant note\fR:  The effect of \fI$aux_dir\fR, if different from
\fI$out_dir\fR, is achieved by giving \fI(pdf)latex\fR the
\fB-aux-directory\fR.  Currently (Dec. 2011 and later) this only works on the
MiKTeX version of \fI(pdf)latex\fR.

See also the documentation of \fI$out_dir\fR for some complications on
what directory names are suitable.

If you also use the \fB-cd\fR option, and \fI$out_dir\fR (or \fI$aux_dir\fR) contains a
relative path, then the path is interpreted relative to the document
directory.

.TP
.B $banner [0]
If nonzero, the banner message is printed across each page when
converting the dvi file to postscript.  Without modifying the variable
\fI$banner_message\fR, this is equivalent to specifying the \fB-d\fR
option.

Note that if \fB$banner\fR is nonzero, the \fB$postscript_mode\fR is
assumed and the postscript file is always generated, even if it is newer
than the dvi file.
.TP
.B $banner_intensity [0.95]
Equivalent to the \fB-bi\fR option, this is a decimal number between 0
and 1 that specifies how dark to print the banner message. 0 is black,
1 is white.  The default is just right if your toner cartridge isn't
running too low.
.TP
.B $banner_message ["DRAFT"]
The banner message to print across each page when converting the dvi
file to postscript.  This is equivalent to the \fB-bm\fR option.
.TP
.B $banner_scale [220.0]
A decimal number that specifies how large the banner message will be
printed.  Experimentation is necessary to get the right scale for your
message, as a rule of thumb the scale should be about equal to 1100
divided by the number of characters in the message.  The Default is
just right for 5 character messages.  This is equivalent to the
\fB-bs\fR option.
.TP
.B @BIBINPUTS
This is an array variable, now mostly obsolete, that specifies
directories where 
\fIlatexmk\fR should look for .bib files.  By default it is set from
the BIBINPUTS environment variable of the operating system.  If that
environment variable is not set, a single element list consisting of
the current directory is set.  The format of the directory names
depends on your operating system, of course.  Examples for setting
this variable are:

        @BIBINPUTS = ( ".", "C:\\\\bibfiles" );
        @BIBINPUTS = ( ".", "\\\\server\\bibfiles" );
        @BIBINPUTS = ( ".", "C:/bibfiles" );
        @BIBINPUTS = ( ".", "//server/bibfiles" );
        @BIBINPUTS = ( ".", "/usr/local/texmf/bibtex/bib" );

Note that under MS Windows, either a forward slash "/" or a backward
slash "\(rs" can be used to separate pathname components, so the first
two and the second two examples are equivalent.  Each backward slash
should be doubled to avoid running afoul of \fIPerl\fR's rules for writing
strings. 

\fIImportant note:\fR This variable is now mostly obsolete in the
current version of \fIlatexmk\fR, 
since it has a better method of searching for files using the
kpsewhich command.  However, if your system is an unusual one without
the kpsewhich command, you may need to set the variable \fI@BIBINPUTS\fR.
.TP
.B $biber ["biber %O %S"]
The biber processing program.
.TP
.B $biber_silent_switch ["--onlylog"]
Switch(es) for the biber processing program when silent mode is on.
.TP
.B $bibtex ["bibtex %O %S"]
The BibTeX processing program.
.TP
.B $bibtex_silent_switch ["-terse"]
Switch(es) for the BibTeX processing program when silent mode is on.
.TP
.B $bibtex_use [1]
Under what conditions to run \fIbibtex\fR or \fIbiber\fR.  When
\fIlatexmk\fR discovers
from the log file that one (or more)
\fIbibtex\fR/\fIbiber\fR-generated bibliographies 
are used, it can run \fIbibtex\fR or \fIbiber\fR whenever it appears
necessary to regenerate the bbl file(s) from their source bib database
file(s).

But sometimes, the bib file(s) are not available (e.g., for a document
obtained from an external archive), but the bbl files are provided.
In that case use of \fIbibtex\fR or \fIbiber\fR will result in incorrect
overwriting of the precious bbl files.  The variable \fI$bibtex_use\fR
controls whether this happens.  Its possible values are: 0: never use
BibTeX or biber.  1: only use \fIbibtex\fR or \fIbiber\fR if the bib
files exist. 
2: run \fIbibtex\fR or \fIbiber\fR whenever it appears necessary to
update the bbl 
files, without testing for the existence of the bib files.
.TP
.B $cleanup_includes_cusdep_generated [0]
If nonzero, specifies that cleanup also deletes files that are
generated by custom dependencies.
(When doing a clean up, e.g., by use of the \fB-C\fR option, custom
dependencies are those listed in the \fI.fdb_latexmk\fR file from a
previous run.)
.TP
.B $cleanup_includes_generated [0]
If nonzero, specifies that cleanup also deletes files that are
detected in log file as being generated (see the \\openout lines in
the log file).  It will also include files made from these first
generation generated files.
.TP
.B $cleanup_mode [0]
If nonzero, specifies cleanup mode: 1 for full cleanup, 2 for cleanup
except for dvi, ps and pdf files, 3 for cleanup except for dep and aux
files.  (There is also extra cleaning as specified by the
\fI$clean_ext\fR, \fI$clean_full_ext\fR and \fI@generated_exts\fR
variables.)

This variable is equivalent to specifying one of
the \fB-c\fR or \fB-C\fR options.  But there should be no need
to set this variable from an RC file.
.TP
.B $clean_ext [""]
Extra extensions of files for \fIlatexmk\fR to remove when any of the
clean-up options (\fB-c\fR or \fB-C\fR) is selected.
The value of this variable is a string containing the extensions
separated by spaces.

It is also possible to specify a more general pattern of file to be
deleted, by using the place holder %R, as in commands, and it is also
possible to use wildcards.  Thus setting

   $clean_ext = "out %R-blx.bib %R-figures*.log";

in an initialization file will imply that when a clean-up operation is
specified, not only is the standard set of files deleted, but also
files of the form FOO.out, FOO-blx.bib, and %R-figures*.log, where FOO
stands for the basename of the file being processed (as in FOO.tex).

.TP
.B $clean_full_ext [""]
Extra extensions of files for \fIlatexmk\fR to remove when the \fB-C\fR
option is selected, i.e., extensions of files to remove when the .dvi,
etc files are to be cleaned-up.

More general patterns are allowed, as for \fI$clean_ext\fR.

.TP
.B $compiling_cmd [undefined], $failure_cmd [undefined], $success_cmd [undefined]

These variables specify commands that are executed at certain points
of compilations during preview-continuous mode.  One motivation for
their existance is to allow convenient visual indications of
compilation status even when the window receiving the screen output of
the compilation is hidden.

The commands are executed at the following points:
$compiling_cmd at the start of compilation, $success_cmd at the end of
a successful compilation, and $failure_cmd at the end of an
unsuccessful compilation.  If any of above variables is undefined (the
default situation) or blank, then the corresponding command is not
executed.  

An example of a typical setting of these variables is as follows

    $compiling_cmd = "xdotool search --name \\"%D\\" set_window --name \\"%D compiling\\"";
    $success_cmd   = "xdotool search --name \\"%D\\" set_window --name \\"%D OK\\"";
    $failure_cmd   = "xdotool search --name \\"%D\\" set_window --name \\"%D FAILURE\\"";

These assume that the program \fIxdotool\fR is installed, that the
previewer is using an X-Window system for display, and that the title
of the window contains the name of the displayed file, as it normally
does.  When the commands are executed, the placeholder string %D is replaced by
the name of the destination file, which is the previewed file.  The
above commands result in an appropriate string being appended to the
filename in the window title: " compiling", " OK", or " FAILURE".  

Other placeholders that can be used are %S, %T, and %R, with %S and %T
normally being identical. These can be useful for a command changing
the title of the edit window. The visual indication in a window title
can useful, since the user does not have to keep shifting attention to
the (possibly hidden) compilation window to know the status of the
compilation.

.TP
.B @cus_dep_list [()]
Custom dependency list -- see section on "Custom Dependencies".

.TP
.B @default_excluded_files [()]
When \fIlatexmk\fR is invoked with no files specified on the command
line, then, by default, it will process all files in the current
directory with the extension .tex.  (In general, it will process the
files specified in the \fI@default_files\fR variable.)

But sometimes you want to exclude particular files from this default
list.  In that case you can specify the excluded files in the array
\fI@default_excluded_files\fR.  For example if you wanted to process
all .tex files with the exception of common.tex, which is a not a
standard alone LaTeX file but a file input by some or all of the
others, you could do

     @default_files = ("*.tex");

     @default_excluded_files = ("common.tex");

If you have a variable or large number of files to be processed, this
method saves you from having to list them in detail in
\fI@default_files\fR and having to update the list every time you
change the set of files to be processed.

Notes: 1. This variable has no effect except when no files are
specified on the \fIlatexmk\fR command line.  2. Wildcards are allowed
in \fI@default_excluded_files\fR.

.TP
.B @default_files [("*.tex")]
Default list of files to be processed.  

If no filenames are specified on the command line,
\fIlatexmk\fR processes all tex files specified in the \fI@default_files\fR
variable, which by default is set to all tex files ("*.tex") in the
current directory.  This is a convenience: just run \fIlatexmk\fR and
it will process an appropriate set of files.  But sometimes you want
only some of these files to be processed.  In this case you can list
the files to be processed by setting
\fI@default_files\fR in an initialization file
(e.g., the file "latexmkrc" in the current directory).  Then if no
files are specified on the command line then the files you specify by
setting \fI@default_files\fR are processed.

Three examples:

     @default_files = ("paper_current");

     @default_files = ("paper1", "paper2.tex");

     @default_files = ("*.tex", "*.dtx");

Note that more than file may be given, and that the default extension
is ".tex".  Wild cards are allowed.  The parentheses are because
\fI@default_files\fR is an array variable, i.e., a sequence of
filename specifications is possible.

If you want \fIlatexmk\fR to process all .tex files with a few
exceptions, see the \fI@default_excluded_files\fR array variable.

.TP
.B $dependents_phony [0]
If a list of dependencies is output, this variable determines whether
to include a phony target for each source file.  If you use the
dependents list in a Makefile, the dummy rules work around errors make
gives if you remove header files without updating the Makefile to
match.
.TP
.B $dependents_list [0]
Whether to display a list(s) of dependencies at the end of a run.
.TP
.B $deps_file ["-"]
Name of file to receive list(s) of dependencies at the end of a run,
to be used if \fI$dependesnt_list\fR is set.  If the filename is "-",
then the dependency list is set to stdout (i.e., normally the screen).
.TP
.B $do_cd [0]
Whether to change working directory to the directory specified for the
main source file before processing it.  The default behavior is not to
do this, which is the same as the behavior of \fIlatex\fR and
\fIpdflatex\fR programs.  This variable is set by the \fB-cd\fR and
\fB-cd-\fR options on \fIlatexmk\fR's command line.
.TP
.B $dvi_filter [empty]
The dvi file filter to be run on the newly produced dvi file before
other processing.  Equivalent to specifying the \fB-dF\fR option.
.TP
.B $dvi_mode [See below for default]
If nonzero, generate a dvi version of the document.  
Equivalent to the \fB-dvi\fR option.

The variable $dvi_mode defaults to 0, but if no explicit requests are
made for other types of file (postscript, pdf), then $dvi_mode will be
set to 1.  In addition, if a request for a file for which a .dvi file
is a prerequisite, then $dvi_mode will be set to 1.  
.TP
.B $dvi_previewer ["start xdvi %O %S" under UNIX]
The command to invoke a dvi-previewer.
[Under MS-Windows the default is "start"; then \fIlatexmk\fR arranges to
use the MS-Windows \fIstart\fR program, which will cause to be run
whatever command the system has associated with .dvi files.]

\fBImportant note\fR: Normally you will want to have a previewer run
detached, so that \fIlatexmk\fR doesn't wait for the previewer to
terminate before continuing its work.  So normally you should prefix
the command by "start ", which flags to \fIlatexmk\fR that it should
do the detaching of the previewer itself (by whatever method is
appropriate to the operating system).  But sometimes letting
\fIlatexmk\fR do the detaching is not appropriate (for a variety of
non-trivial reasons), so you should put the "start " bit in
yourself, whenever it is needed.

.TP
.B $dvi_previewer_landscape ["start xdvi %O %S"]
The command to invoke a dvi-previewer in landscape mode.
[Under MS-Windows the default is "start"; then \fIlatexmk\fR arranges to
use the MS-Windows \fIstart\fR program, which will cause to be run
whatever command the system has associated with .dvi files.]

.TP
.B $dvipdf ["dvipdf %O %S %D"]
Command to convert dvi to pdf file.  A common reconfiguration is to
use the dvipdfm command, which needs its arguments in a different order:

     $dvipdf = "dvipdfm %O -o %D %S";

WARNING: The default dvipdf script generates pdf files with bitmapped
fonts, which do not look good when viewed by acroread.  That script
should be modified to give dvips the options "-P pdf" to ensure that
type 1 fonts are used in the pdf file.

.TP
.B $dvipdf_silent_switch ["-q"]
Switch(es) for dvipdf program when silent mode is on.

N.B. The standard dvipdf program runs silently, so adding the silent
switch has no effect, but is actually innocuous.  But if an
alternative program is used, e.g., dvipdfmx, then the silent switch
has an effect.  The default setting is correct for \fIdvipdfm\fR and
\fIdvipdfmx\fR.
.TP
.B $dvips ["dvips %O -o %D %S"]
The program to used as a filter to convert a .dvi file to a .ps file.  
If pdf is going to be generated from pdf, then the value of the
\fI$dvips_pdf_switch\fR variable -- see below -- will be included in
the options substituted for "%O".
.TP
.B $dvips_landscape ["dvips -tlandscape %O -o %D %S"]
The program to used as a filter to convert a .dvi file to a .ps file
in landscape mode.
.TP
.B $dvips_pdf_switch ["-P pdf"]
Switch(es) for \fIdvips\fR program when pdf file is to be generated
from ps file. 
.TP
.B $dvips_silent_switch ["-q"]
Switch(es) for \fIdvips\fR program when silent mode is on.
.TP
.B $dvi_update_command [""]
When the dvi previewer is set to be updated by running a command, this
is the command that is run.  See the information for the variable
\fI$dvi_update_method\fR for further information, and see information
on the variable \fI$pdf_update_method\fR for an example for the
analogous case of a pdf previewer.
.TP
.B $dvi_update_method [2 under UNIX, 1 under MS-Windows]
How the dvi viewer updates its display when the dvi file has changed.
The values here apply equally to the \fI$pdf_update_method\fR and to
the \fI$ps_update_method\fR variables.
    0 => update is automatic, 
    1=> manual update by user, which may only mean a mouse click on the
viewer's window or may mean a more serious action.
    2 => Send the signal, whose number is in the variable
\fI$dvi_update_signal\fR.  The default value under UNIX is
suitable for \fIxdvi\fR. 
    3 => Viewer cannot do an update, because it locks the file. (As with
\fIacroread\fR under MS-Windows.)
    4 => run a command to do the update.  The command is specified by
the variable \fI$dvi_update_command\fR.   

See information on the variable \fI$pdf_update_method\fR for an
example of updating by command.
.TP
.B $dvi_update_signal [Under UNIX: SIGUSR1, which is a system-dependent value]
The number of the signal that is sent to the dvi viewer when it is
updated by sending a signal -- see the information on the variable
\fI$dvi_update_method\fR.  The default value is the one appropriate
for \fIxdvi\fR on a UNIX system.
.TP
.B $failure_cmd [undefined]
See the documentation for \fI$compiling_cmd\fR.
.TP
.B $fdb_ext ["fdb_latexmk"]
The extension of the file which \fIlatexmk\fR generates to contain a
database of information on source files.  You will not normally need
to change this.
.TP
.B $force_mode [0]
If nonzero, continue processing past minor \fIlatex\fR errors 
including unrecognized cross references.  Equivalent to specifying the
\fB-f\fR option.
.TP
.B @generated_exts [( "aux", "bbl", "idx", "ind", "lof", "lot", "out", "toc", $fdb_ext )]
This contains a list of extensions for files that are generated during
a LaTeX run and that are read in by LaTeX in later runs, either
directly or indirectly. 

This list has two uses: (a) to set the kinds of file to be deleted in
a cleanup operation (with the \fB-c\fR, \fB-C\fR, \fB-CA\fR, \fB-g\fR
and \fB-gg\fR options), and (b) in the determination of whether a
rerun of (pdf)LaTeX is needed after a run that gives an error.

(Normally, a change of a source file during a run should provoke a
rerun.  This includes a file generated by LaTeX, e.g., an aux file,
that is read in on subsequent runs.  But after a run that results in
an error, a new run should occur until the user has made a change in
the files.  But the user may have corrected an error in a source .tex
file during the run.  So \fIlatexmk\fR needs to distinguish
user-generated and automatically generated files; it determines the
automatically generated files as those with extensions in the list in
@generated_exts.)

A convenient way to add an extra extension to the list, without losing
the already defined ones is to use a push command in the line in an
RC file.  E.g.,

                push @generated_exts, "end";

adds the extension "end" to the list of predefined generated
extensions.  (This extension is used by the RevTeX package, for
example.) 
.TP
.B $go_mode [0]
If nonzero, process files regardless of timestamps, and is then
equivalent to the \fB-g\fR option.
.TP
.B %hash_calc_ignore_pattern
\fB!!!This variable is for experts only!!!\fR

The general rule \fIlatexmk\fR uses for determining when an extra run
of some program is needed is that one of the source files has changed.
But consider for example a latex package that causes an encapsulated
postscript file (an "eps" file) to be made that is to be read in on
the next run.  The file contains a comment line giving its creation
date and time.  On the next run the time changes, \fIlatex\fR sees
that the eps file has changed, and therefore reruns latex.  This
causes an infinite loop, that is only terminated because \fIlatexmk\fR
has a limit 
on the number of runs to guard against pathological situations.

But the changing line has no real effect, since it is a comment.  You
can instruct \fIlatex\fR to ignore the offending line as follows:

   $hash_calc_ignore_pattern{'eps'} = '^%%CreationDate: ';

This creates a rule for files with extension \fI.eps\fR about lines to
ignore.  The left-hand side is a \fIPerl\fR idiom for setting an item
in a hash.  Note that the file extension is specified without a
period.  The value, on the right-hand side, is a string containing a
regular expresssion.  (See documentation on \fIPerl\fR for how they
are to be specified in general.)  This particular regular expression
specifies that lines beginning with "%%CreationDate: " are to be
ignored in deciding whether a file of the given extension \fI.eps\fR
has changed.

There is only one regular expression available for each extension.  If
you need more one pattern to specify lines to ignore, then you need to
combine the patterns into a single regular expression.  The simplest
method is separate the different simple patterns by a vertical bar
character (indicating "alternation" in the jargon of regular
expressions).  For example,

   $hash_calc_ignore_pattern{'eps'} = '^%%CreationDate: |^%%Title: ';

causes lines starting with either "^%%CreationDate: " or "^%%Title: "
to be ignored.  

It may happen that a pattern to be ignored is specified in, for
example, in a system or user initialization file, and you wish to
remove this in a file that is read later.  To do this, you use Perl's
delete function, e.g.,

    delete $hash_calc_ignore_pattern{'eps'};

.TP
.B $kpsewhich ["kpsewhich %S"]
The program called to locate a source file when the name alone is not
sufficient.  Most filenames used by \fIlatexmk\fR have sufficient path
information to be found directly.  But sometimes, notably when a .bib
or a .bst file is found from the log file of a \fIbibtex\fR or
\fIbiber\fR run, only the base name of the file is known, but not its
path. The program specified by \fI$kpsewhich\fR is used to find it.

(\fIFor advanced users:\fR Because of the different way in which
\fIlatexmk\fR uses the command specified in \fI$kpsewhich\fR, some of
the possibilities listed in the FORMAT OF COMMAND SPECIFICATIONS do
not apply.  The \fIinternal\fR and \fIstart\fR keywords are not
available. A simple command specification with possible options and
then "%S" is all that is guaranteed to work.  Note that for other
commands, "%S" is substituted by a single source file. In contrast,
for \fI$kpsewhich\fR, "%S" may be substituted by a long list of
space-separated filenames, each of which is quoted.  The result on
STDOUT of running the command is then piped to \fIlatexmk\fR.)

See also the \fI@BIBINPUTS\fR variable for another way that \fIlatexmk\fR
also uses to try to locate files; it applies only in the case of .bib
files.

.TP
.B $kpsewhich_show [0]
Whether to show diagnostics about invocations of \fIkpsewhich\fR: the
command line use to invoke it and the results.  These diagnostics are
shown if \fI$kpsewhich_show\fR is non-zero or if diagnostics mode is
on.  (But in the second case, lots of other diagnostics are also
shown.)  Without these diagnostics there is nothing visible in
\fIlatexmk\fR's screen output about invocations of \fIkpsewhich\fR.

.TP
.B $landscape_mode [0]
If nonzero, run in landscape mode, using the landscape mode previewers and
dvi to postscript converters.  Equivalent to the \fB-l\fR option.
Normally not needed with current previewers.
.TP
.B $latex ["latex %O %S"]
The LaTeX processing program.  Note that as with other programs, you
can use this variable not just to change the name of the program used,
but also specify options to the program.  E.g.,

	$latex = "latex --src-specials";
.TP
.B %latex_input_extensions
This variable specifies the extensions tried by \fIlatexmk\fR when it finds
that a LaTeX run resulted in an error that a file has not been found,
and the file is given without an extension.  This typically happens when
LaTeX commands of the form \\input{file} or \\includegraphics{figure},
when the relevant source file does not exist.

In this situation, \fIlatexmk\fR searches for custom dependencies to make
the missing file(s), but restricts it to the extensions specified by
the variable %latex_input_extensions.  The default extensions 
are 'tex' and 'eps'.

(For Perl experts: %latex_input_extensions is a hash whose keys are
the extensions.  The values are irrelevant.)  Two subroutines are
provided for manipulating this and the related variable
%pdflatex_input_extensions, add_input_ext and remove_input_ext.  They
are used as in the following examples are possible lines in an
initialization file:

    remove_input_ext( 'latex', 'tex' );

removes the extension 'tex' from latex_input_extensions

    add_input_ext( 'latex', 'asdf' );

add the extension 'asdf to latex_input_extensions.  (Naturally with
such an extension, you should have made an appropriate custom
dependency for \fIlatexmk\fR, and should also have done the appropriate
programming in the LaTeX source file to enable the file to be read.
The standard extensions are handled by LaTeX and its graphics/graphicx
packages. 

.TP
.B $latex_silent_switch ["-interaction=batchmode"]
Switch(es) for the LaTeX processing program when silent mode is on.

If you use MikTeX, you may prefer the results if you configure the
options to include -c-style-errors, e.g., by the following line in an
initialization file

  $latex_silent_switch = "-interaction=batchmode -c-style-errors";

.TP
.B $lpr ["lpr  %O %S" under UNIX/Linux, \(dqNONE lpr\(dq under MS-Windows]
The command to print postscript files.

Under MS-Windows (unlike UNIX/Linux), there is no standard program for
printing files.  But there are ways you can do it.  For example, if
you have \fIgsview\fR installed, you could use it with the option "/p":

    $lpr = '"c:/Program Files/Ghostgum/gsview/gsview32.exe" /p';

If \fIgsview\fR is installed in a different directory, you will need to make
the appropriate change.  Note the combination of single and double
quotes around the name.  The single quotes specify that this is a
string to be assigned to the configuration variable \fI$lpr\fR.  The double
quotes are part of the string passed to the operating system to get
the command obeyed; this is necessary because one part of the command
name ("Program Files") contains a space which would otherwise be
misinterpreted.
.TP
.B $lpr_dvi ["NONE lpr_dvi"]
The printing program to print dvi files.
.TP
.B $lpr_pdf ["NONE lpr_pdf"]
The printing program to print pdf files.

Under MS-Windows you could set this to use \fIgsview\fR, if it is installed,
e.g.,

    $lpr = '"c:/Program Files/Ghostgum/gsview/gsview32.exe" /p';

If \fIgsview\fR is installed in a different directory, you will need to make
the appropriate change.  Note the double quotes around the name: this
is necessary because one part of the command name ("Program Files")
contains a space which would otherwise be misinterpreted. 

.TP
.B $lualatex ["lualatex %O %S"]
The LaTeX processing program that is to be used when the \fIlualatex\fR
program is called for (e.g., by the option \fB-lualatex\fR.

.TP
.B %lualatex_input_extensions
This variable specifies the extensions tried by \fIlatexmk\fR when it finds
that a \fIlualatex\fR run resulted in an error that a file has not been found,
and the file is given without an extension.  This typically happens when
LaTeX commands of the form \\input{file} or \\includegraphics{figure},
when the relevant source file does not exist.

In this situation, \fIlatexmk\fR searches for custom dependencies to make
the missing file(s), but restricts it to the extensions specified by
the variable %pdflatex_input_extensions.  The default extensions 
are 'tex', 'pdf', 'jpg, and 'png'.

See details of the \fI%latex_input_extensions\fR for other information
that equally applies to \fI%lualatex_input_extensions\fR.

.TP
.B $lualatex_silent_switch  ["-interaction=batchmode"]
Switch(es) for the \fIlualatex\fR program (specified in the variable
\fI$lualatex\fR) when silent mode is on.

See details of the \fI$latex_silent_switch\fR for other information
that equally applies to \fI$lualatex_silent_switch\fR.

.TP
.B $make ["make"]
The make processing program.

.TP
.B $makeindex ["makeindex %O -o %D %S"]
The index processing program.
.TP
.B $makeindex_silent_switch ["-q"]
\fBSwitch(es)\fR for the index processing program when silent mode is on.
.TP
.B $max_repeat  [5]
The maximum number of times \fIlatexmk\fR will run latex/pdflatex
before deciding that there may be an infinite loop and that it needs
to bail out, rather than rerunning latex/pdflatex again to resolve
cross-references, etc.  The default value covers all normal cases.

(Note that the "etc" covers a lot of cases where one run of
latex/pdflatex generates files to be read in on a later run.)
.TP
.B $MSWin_back_slash [1]
This configuration variable only has an effect when \fIlatexmk\fR is
running under MS-Windows.  It determines whether, when a command is
executed under MS-Windows, there should be substituted "\\" for the
separator character between components of a directory name.
Internally, \fIlatexmk\fR uses "/" for the directory separator
character, which is the character used by Unix-like systems.

For many programs under MS-Windows, both "\\" and "/" are acceptable
as the directory separator character.  But some programs only accept
"\\" on the command line.  So for safety \fIlatexmk\fR makes a
translation, by default.
It is conceivable that under certain situations this is undesirable,
so the configuration can be changed.  (A possible example might be
when some of the software is implemented using Cygwin, which provides
a Unix-like environment inside MS-Windows.)

.TP
.B $new_viewer_always [0]
This variable applies to \fIlatexmk\fR \fBonly\fR in
continuous-preview mode.  If \fI$new_viewer_always\fR is 0,
\fIlatexmk\fR will check for a previously running previewer on the
same file, and if one is running will not start a new one.  If
\fI$new_viewer_always\fR is non-zero, this check will be skipped, and
\fIlatexmk\fR will behave as if no viewer is running.
.TP

.B $out_dir [""]
If non-blank, this variable specifies the directory in which output
files are to be written by a run of 
(pdf)latex.  See also the variable \fI$aux_dir\fR.  

The effect of this variable (when non-blank) is achieved by using the
\fB-output-directory\fR option of (pdf)latex.  This exists in the
usual current (Dec. 2011 and later) implementations of TeX, i.e., MiKTeX and
TeXLive. But it may not be present in other versions.

If you also use the \fB-cd\fR option, and \fI$out_dir\fR (or \fI$aux_dir\fR) contains a
relative path, then the path is interpreted relative to the document
directory.

Commonly, the directory specified for output files is a subdirectory
of the current working directory.  However, if you specify some other
directory, e.g., "/tmp/foo" or "../output", be aware that this could
cause problems, e.g., with \fImakeindex\fR or \fIbibtex\fR.  This is
because modern versions of these programs, by default, will refuse to
work when they find that they are asked to write to a file in a
directory that appears not to be the current working directory or one
of its subdirectories.  This is part of security measures by the whole
TeX system that try to prevent malicious or errant TeX documents from
incorrectly messing with a user's files.  If for \fI$out_dir\fR or
\fI$aux_dir\fR you really do need to specify an absolute pathname
(e.g., "/tmp/foo") or a path (e.g., "../output") that includes a
higher-level directory, and you need to use \fImakeindex\fR or
\fIbibtex\fR, then you need to disable the security measures
(and assume any risks).  One way of doing this is to temporarily set an
operating system environment variable openout_any to "a" (as in
"all"), to override the default "paranoid" setting.
.TP

.B $pdf_mode [0]
If zero, do NOT generate a pdf version of the document.
If equal to 1, generate a pdf version of the document using \fIpdflatex\fR,
using the command specified by the \fI$pdflatex\fR variable.  
If equal to 2, generate a pdf version of the document from the ps
file, by using the command specified by the \fI$ps2pdf\fR variable.  
If equal to 3, generate a pdf version of the document from the dvi
file, by using the command specified by the \fI$dvipdf\fR variable.  
If equal to 4, generate a pdf version of the document using \fIlualatex\fR,
using the command specified by the \fI$lualatex\fR variable.
If equal to 5, generate a pdf version (and an xdv version) of the
document using \fIxelatex\fR, using the commands specified by the
\fI$xelatex\fR and \fIxdvipdfmx\fR variables.

In \fI$pdf_mode\fR=2, it is ensured that dvi and ps files are also made.
In \fI$pdf_mode\fR=3, it is ensured that a dvi file is also made.

.TP

.B $pdflatex ["pdflatex %O %S"]
The LaTeX processing program in a version that makes a pdf file instead
of a dvi file.

An example use of this variable is to add certain options to the
command line for the program, e.g.,

     $pdflatex = "pdflatex --shell-escape %O %S";

(In some earlier versions of \fIlatexmk\fR, you needed to use an assignment
to \fI$pdflatex\fR to allow the use of \fIlualatex\fR or \fIxelatex\fR
instead of \fIpdflatex\fR.  There are now separate configuration
variables for the use of \fIlualatex\fR or \fIxelatex\fR.  See
\fI$lualatex\fR and \fI$xelatex\fR.)

.TP
.B %pdflatex_input_extensions
This variable specifies the extensions tried by \fIlatexmk\fR when it finds
that a \fIpdflatex\fR run resulted in an error that a file has not been found,
and the file is given without an extension.  This typically happens when
LaTeX commands of the form \\input{file} or \\includegraphics{figure},
when the relevant source file does not exist.

In this situation, \fIlatexmk\fR searches for custom dependencies to make
the missing file(s), but restricts it to the extensions specified by
the variable %pdflatex_input_extensions.  The default extensions 
are 'tex', 'pdf', 'jpg, and 'png'.

See details of the \fI%latex_input_extensions\fR for other information
that equally applies to \fI%pdflatex_input_extensions\fR.

.TP
.B $pdflatex_silent_switch  ["-interaction=batchmode"]
Switch(es) for the \fIpdflatex\fR program (specified in the variable
\fI$pdflatex\fR) when silent mode is on.

See details of the \fI$latex_silent_switch\fR for other information
that equally applies to \fI$pdflatex_silent_switch\fR.

.TP
.B $pdf_previewer ["start acroread %O %S"]
The command to invoke a pdf-previewer.

On MS-Windows, the default is changed to "cmd /c start """; under more recent versions of
Windows, this will cause to be run whatever command the system has
associated with .pdf files.  But this may be undesirable if this
association is to \fIacroread\fR -- see the notes in the explanation
of the \fB-pvc\fR option.]  

On OS-X the default is changed to "open %S", which results in OS-X
starting up (and detaching) the viewer associated with the file.  By
default, for pdf files this association is to OS-X's preview, which is
quite satisfactory.

\fBWARNING\fR:  Problem under MS-Windows:
if acroread is used as the pdf previewer, and it is
actually viewing a pdf file, the pdf file cannot be updated.  Thus
makes acroread a bad choice of previewer if you use \fIlatexmk\fR's
previous-continuous mode (option \fB-pvc\fR) under MS-windows.
This problem does not occur if, for example, \fISumatraPDF\fR or \fIgsview\fR is
used to view pdf files.

\fBImportant note\fR: Normally you will want to have a previewer run
detached, so that \fIlatexmk\fR doesn't wait for the previewer to
terminate before continuing its work.  So normally you should prefix
the command by "start ", which flags to \fIlatexmk\fR that it should
do the detaching of the previewer itself (by whatever method is
appropriate to the operating system).  But sometimes letting
\fIlatexmk\fR do the detaching is not appropriate (for a variety of
non-trivial reasons), so you should put the "start " bit in
yourself, whenever it is needed.

.TP
.B $pdf_update_command [""]
When the pdf previewer is set to be updated by running a command, this
is the command that is run.  See the information for the variable
\fI$pdf_update_method\fR. 
.TP
.B $pdf_update_method [1 under UNIX, 3 under MS-Windows]
How the pdf viewer updates its display when the pdf file has
changed. See the information on the variable \fI$dvi_update_method\fR
for the codes.  (Note that information needs be changed slightly so
that for the value 4, to run a command to do the update, the command
is specified by the variable \fI$pdf_update_command\fR, and for the
value 2, to specify update by signal, the signal is specified by
\fI$pdf_update_signal\fR.)

Note that acroread under MS-Windows (but not UNIX) locks the pdf file, so
the default value is then 3.  

Arranging to use a command to get a previewer explicitly updated
requires three variables to be set.  For example:

    $pdf_previewer = "start xpdf -remote %R %O %S";
    $pdf_update_method = 4;
    $pdf_update_command = "xpdf -remote %R -reload";

The first setting arranges for the xpdf program to be used in its
"remote server mode", with the server name specified as the rootname
of the TeX file.  The second setting arranges for updating to be done
in response to a command, and the third setting sets the update command.

.TP
.B $pdf_update_signal [Under UNIX: SIGHUP, which is a system-dependent value]
The number of the signal that is sent to the pdf viewer when it is
updated by sending a signal -- see the information on the variable
\fI$pdf_update_method\fR.  The default value is the one appropriate
for \fIgv\fR on a UNIX system.
.TP
.B $pid_position[1 under UNIX, -1 under MS-Windows]     
The variable \fI$pid_position\fR is used to
specify which word in lines of the output from \fI$pscmd\fR
corresponds to the process ID.  The first word in the line is numbered
0.  The default value of 1 (2nd word in line) is correct for Solaris
2.6, Linux, and OS-X with their default settings of \fI$pscmd\fR.

Setting the variable to -1 is used to indicate that
\fI$pscmd\fR is not to be used.
.TP
.B $postscript_mode [0]
If nonzero, generate a postscript version of the document.  
Equivalent to the \fB-ps\fR option.

If some other request is made for which a postscript file is needed,
then $postscript_mode will be set to 1.
.TP
.B $preview_continuous_mode [0]
If nonzero, run a previewer to view the document, and
continue running \fIlatexmk\fR to keep .dvi up-to-date.  Equivalent to
the \fB-pvc\fR option.
Which previewer is run depends on the other settings, see the command
line options \fB-view=\fR, and the variable \fI$view\fR.  
.TP
.B $preview_mode [0]
If nonzero, run a previewer to preview the document.
Equivalent to the \fB-pv\fR option.  
Which previewer is run depends on the other settings, see the command
line options \fB-view=\fR, and the variable \fI$view\fR.  
.TP
.B $printout_mode [0]
If nonzero, print the document using the command specified in the
\fI$lpr\fR variable.  Equivalent to the
\fB-p\fR option.  This is recommended \fBnot\fR to be set from an RC
file, otherwise you could waste lots of paper.
.TP
.B $print_type = ["auto"]
Type of file to printout: possibilities are "auto", "dvi", "none",
"pdf", or "ps".   See the option \fB-print=\fR for the meaning of the
"auto" value.
.TP
.B $pscmd
Command used to get all the processes currently run by the user.  The
-pvc option uses the command specified by the variable \fI$pscmd\fR to
determine if there is an already running previewer, and to find the
process ID (needed if \fIlatexmk\fR needs to signal the previewer
about file changes).  

Each line of the output of this command is assumed to correspond to
one process.  See the \fI$pid_position\fR variable for how the process
number is determined.

The default for \fIpscmd\fR is "NONE" under MS-Windows and cygwin
(i.e., the command is not used), "ps -ww -u $ENV{USER}" under 
OS-X, and 
"ps -f -u $ENV{USER}" under other operating systems (including Linux).
In these specifications "$ENV{USER}" is substituted by the username.
.TP
.B $ps2pdf ["ps2pdf  %O %S %D"]
Command to convert ps to pdf file.  
.TP
.B $ps_filter [empty]
The postscript file filter to be run on the newly produced postscript
file before other processing.  Equivalent to specifying the \fB-pF\fR
option.
.TP
.B $ps_previewer ["start gv %O %S", but "start %O %S" under MS-Windows]
The command to invoke a ps-previewer.  (The default under MS-Windows
will cause to be run whatever command the system has associated 
with .ps files.)

Note that \fIgv\fR could be used with the -watch option updates its display
whenever the postscript file changes, whereas ghostview does not.
However, different versions of \fIgv\fR have slightly different ways of
writing this option.  You can configure this variable appropriately.

\fBWARNING\fR: Linux systems may have installed one (or more) versions
of \fIgv\fR under different names, e.g., \fIggv\fR, \fIkghostview\fR,
etc, but perhaps not one actually called \fIgv\fR.

\fBImportant note\fR: Normally you will want to have a previewer run
detached, so that \fIlatexmk\fR doesn't wait for the previewer to
terminate before continuing its work.  So normally you should prefix
the command by "start ", which flags to \fIlatexmk\fR that it should
do the detaching of the previewer itself (by whatever method is
appropriate to the operating system).  But sometimes letting
\fIlatexmk\fR do the detaching is not appropriate (for a variety of
non-trivial reasons), so you should put the "start " bit in
yourself, whenever it is needed.

.TP
.B $ps_previewer_landscape ["start gv -swap %O %S", but "start %O %S" under MS-Windows]
The command to invoke a ps-previewer in landscape mode.
.TP
.B $ps_update_command [""]
When the postscript previewer is set to be updated by running a command, this
is the command that is run.  See the information for the variable
\fI$ps_update_method\fR. 
.TP
.B $ps_update_method [0 under UNIX, 1 under MS-Windows]
How the postscript viewer updates its display when the ps file has
changed. See the information on the variable \fI$dvi_update_method\fR
for the codes.  (Note that information needs be changed slightly so
that for the value 4, to run a command to do the update, the command
is specified by the variable \fI$ps_update_command\fR, and for the
value 2, to specify update by signal, the signal is specified by
\fI$ps_update_signal\fR.)

.TP
.B $ps_update_signal [Under UNIX: SIGHUP, which is a system-dependent value]
The number of the signal that is sent to the pdf viewer when it is
updated by sending a signal -- see \fI$ps_update_method\fR.  The
default value is the one appropriate for gv on a UNIX system.

.TP
.B $pvc_view_file_via_temporary [1]
The same as \fI$always_view_file_via_temporary\fR, except that it only
applies in preview-continuous mode (-pvc option).

.TP
.B $quote_filenames [1]
This specifies whether substitutions for placeholders in command
specifications (as in \fI$pdflatex\fR) are surrounded by double
quotes.  If this variable is 1 (or any other value Perl regards as
true), then quoting is done.  Otherwise quoting is omitted.  

The quoting method used by \fIlatexmk\fR is tested to work correctly under
UNIX systems (including Linux and Mac OS-X) and under MS-Windows.  It
allows the use of filenames containing special characters, notably
spaces.  (But note that many versions of \fIlatex\fR and \fIpdflatex\fR cannot
correctly deal with TeX files whose names contain spaces.  \fILatexmk\fR's
quoting only ensures that such filenames are correctly treated by the
operating system in passing arguments to programs.)
.TP
.B $recorder [1]
Whether to use the \fB-recorder\fR option to \fIlatex\fR and
\fIpdflatex\fR. Use of this option results in a file of extension
\fI.fls\fR containing a list of the files that these programs have
read and written.  \fILatexmk\fR will then use this file to improve
its detection of source files and generated files after a run of
\fIlatex\fR or \fIpdflatex\fR.

It is generally recommended to use this option (or to configure the
\fI$recorder\fR variable to be on.)  But it only works if
\fI(pdf)latex\fR supports the -recorder option, which is true for most
current implementations

\fINote about the name of the .fls file:\fR Most implementations of
\fI(pdf)latex\fR produce an .fls file with the same basename as the
main document's LaTeX, e.g., for Document.tex, the .fls file is
Document.fls.  However, some implementations instead produce files
named for the program, i.e., latex.fls or pdflatex.fls.  In this
second case, \fIlatexmk\fR copies the latex.fls or pdflatex.fls to a
file with the basename of the main LaTeX document, e.g., Document.fls.

.TP
.B $search_path_separator [See below for default]
The character separating paths in the environment variables TEXINPUTS,
BIBINPUTS, and BSTINPUTS.  This variable is mainly used by
\fIlatexmk\fR when the \fB-outdir\fR, \fB-output-directory\fR,
\fB-auxdir\fR, and/or \fB-aux-directory\fR options are used.  In that
case \fIlatexmk\fR needs to communicate appropriately modified search
paths to \fIbibtex\fR, \fIdvipdf\fR, \fIdvips\fR, and
\fI(pdf)latex\fR.  

[Comment to technically savvy readers: \fI(pdf)latex\fR doesn't
actually need the modified search path.  But, surprisingly,
\fIdvipdf\fR and \fIdvips\fR do, 
because sometimes graphics files get generated in the output or aux
directories.] 

The default under MSWin and Cygwin is ';' and under UNIX-like
operating systems (including Linux and OS-X) is ':'.  Normally the
defaults give correct behavior.  But there can be difficulties if your
operating system is of one kind, but some of your software is running
under an emulator for the other kind of operating system; in that case
you'll need to find out what is needed, and set
\fI$search_path_separator\fR explicitly.  (The same goes, of course,
for unusual operating systems that are not in the MSWin, Linux, OS-X,
Unix collection.)

.TP
.B $show_time [0]
Whether to show CPU time used.

.TP
.B $silence_logfile_warnings [0]
Whether after a run of (pdf)latex to summarize warnings in the log
file about undefined citations and references.  Setting
$silence_logfile_warnings=0 gives the summary of warnings (provided
silent mode isn't also set), and this is useful to locate undefined
citations and references without searching through the much more
verbose log file or the screen output of (pdf)latex.  But the summary
can also be excessively annoying.  The default is not to give these
warnings.  The command line options
\fB-silence_logfile_warning_list\fR and
\fB-silence_logfile_warning_list-\fR also set this variable.

Note that multiple occurrences for the same undefined object on the
same page and same line will be compressed to a single warning.

.TP
.B $silent [0]
Whether to run silently.  Setting $silent to 1 has the same effect as
the \fB-quiet\fR of \fB-silent\fR options on the command line.

.TP
.B $sleep_time [2]
The time to sleep (in seconds) between checking for source file
changes when running with the \fB-pvc\fR option.  This is subject to a
minimum of one second delay, except that zero delay is also allowed.

A value of exactly 0 gives no delay, and typically results in 100% CPU
usage, which may not be desirable.
.TP
.B $texfile_search [""]
This is an obsolete variable, replaced by the \fI@default_files\fR
variable.  

For backward compatibility, if you choose to set
\fI$texfile_search\fR, it is a string of space-separated filenames, and
then \fIlatexmk\fR replaces \fI@default_files\fR with the filenames in
\fI$texfile_search\fR to which is added "*.tex".

.TP
.B $success_cmd [undefined]
See the documentation for $compiling_cmd.

.TP
.B $tmpdir [See below for default]
Directory to store temporary files that \fIlatexmk\fR may generate while
running.  

The default under MSWindows (including cygwin), is to set
\fI$tmpdir\fR to the value of the first of whichever of the system
environment variables TMPDIR or TEMP exists, otherwise to the current
directory.  Under other operating systems (expected to be UNIX/Linux,
including OS-X), the default is the value of the system environment
variable TMPDIR if it exists, otherwise "/tmp".
.TP
.B $use_make_for_missing_files [0]
Whether to use \fImake\fR to try and make files that are missing after
a run of \fIlatex\fR or \fIpdflatex\fR, and for which a custom
dependency has not been found.  This is generally useful only when
\fIlatexmk\fR is used as part of a bigger project which is built by
using the \fImake\fR program.

Note that once a missing file has been made, no further calls to
\fImake\fR will be made on a subsequent run of \fIlatexmk\fR to update
the file.  Handling this problem is the job of a suitably defined
Makefile.  See the section "USING \fIlatexmk\fR WITH \fImake\fR" for
how to do this.  The intent of calling \fImake\fR from \fIlatexmk\fR
is merely to detect dependencies.
.TP
.B $view ["default"]
Which kind of file is to be previewed if a previewer is used.  The
possible values are "default", "dvi", "ps", "pdf".  The value 
of "default" means that the "highest" of the kinds of file generated is
to be used (among dvi, ps and pdf).

.TP
.B $xdvipdfmx ["xdvipdfmx -o %D %O %S"]

The program to make a pdf file from an xdv file (used in conjunction
with \fIxelatex\fR when \fI$pdf_mode\fR=5).

.TP
.B $xdvipdfmx_silent_switch ["-q"]
Switch(es) for the \fIxdvipdfmx\fR program when silent mode is on.

.TP
.B $xelatex ["xelatex %O %S"]
The LaTeX processing program of in a version that makes a pdf file instead
of a dvi file, when the \fIxelatex\fR program is called for.  See the
documentation of the \fB-xelatex\fR option for some special properties
of \fIlatexmk\fR's use of \fIxelatex\fR.

.TP
.B %xelatex_input_extensions
This variable specifies the extensions tried by \fIlatexmk\fR when it finds
that an \fIxelatex\fR run resulted in an error that a file has not been found,
and the file is given without an extension.  This typically happens when
LaTeX commands of the form \\input{file} or \\includegraphics{figure},
when the relevant source file does not exist.

In this situation, \fIlatexmk\fR searches for custom dependencies to make
the missing file(s), but restricts it to the extensions specified by
the variable %xelatex_input_extensions.  The default extensions 
are 'tex', 'pdf', 'jpg, and 'png'.

See details of the \fI%latex_input_extensions\fR for other information
that equally applies to \fI%xelatex_input_extensions\fR.

.TP
.B $xelatex_silent_switch  ["-interaction=batchmode"]
Switch(es) for the \fIxelatex\fR program (specified in the variable
\fI$xelatex\fR) when silent mode is on.

See details of the \fI$latex_silent_switch\fR for other information
that equally applies to \fI$xelatex_silent_switch\fR.



.SH CUSTOM DEPENDENCIES
.PP
In any RC file a set of custom dependencies can be set up to convert a
file with one extension to a file with another.  An example use of this
would be to allow \fIlatexmk\fR to convert a \fI.fig\fR file to
\fI.eps\fR to be included in the \fI.tex\fR file.  

The old method of configuring \fIlatexmk\fR was to directly manipulate
the \fB@cus_dep_list\fR array that contains information defining the
custom dependencies.  This method still works.  But now there are 
subroutines that allow convenient manipulations of the custom
dependency list.  These are

    add_cus_dep( fromextension, toextension, must, subroutine )
    remove_cus_dep( fromextension, toextension )
    show_cus_dep()

The custom dependency is a list of rules, each of which is specified
as follow:
.TP
.B from extension:
The extension of the file we are converting from (e.g. "fig").
It is specified without a period.
.TP
.B to extension:
The extension of the file we are converting to (e.g. "eps").
It is specified without a period.
.TP
.B must:
If non-zero, the file from which we are converting \fBmust\fR exist, if it
doesn't exist \fIlatexmk\fR will give an error message and exit unless
the \fB-f\fR option is specified.  If \fImust\fR is zero and the file
we are converting from doesn't exist, then no action is taken.
.TP
.B function:
The name of the subroutine that \fIlatexmk\fR should call to perform the
file conversion.  The first argument to the subroutine is the base name
of the file to be converted without any extension.  The subroutines are
declared in the syntax of \fIPerl\fR.  The function should return 0 if
it was successful and a nonzero number if it failed.
.PP
A custom dependency rule is invoked whenever \fIlatexmk\fR detects
that a run of 
latex/pdflatex needs to read a file, like a graphics file, whose
extension is the to-extension of a custom dependency.  Then
\fIlatexmk\fR examines whether a file exists with the same name, but
with the corresponding from-extension, as specified in the
custom-dependency rule.  If it does, then the rule whenever the destination
file (the one with the to-extension) is out-of-date with respect to
the corresponding source file.

To make the new destination file, the \fIPerl\fR subroutine specified in the
rule is invoked, with an argument that is the base name of the files
in question.  Simple cases just involve a subroutine invoking an
external program; this can be done by following the templates below,
even by those without knowledge of the \fIPerl\fR programming language.  Of
course, experts could do something much more elaborate.

One other item in each custom-dependency rule, labeled "must" above,
specifies how the rule should be applied when the source file fails to
exist.

A simple and typical example of code in an initialization rcfile is

    add_cus_dep( 'fig', 'eps', 0, 'fig2eps' );
    sub fig2eps {
        return system( "fig2dev -Leps \\"$_[0].fig\\" \\"$_[0].eps\\"" ); 
    }

The first line adds a custom dependency that converts a file with
extension "fig", as created by the \fIxfig\fR program, to an encapsulated
postscript file, with extension "eps".  The remaining lines define a
subroutine that carries out the conversion.  If a rule for converting
"fig" to "eps" files already exists (e.g., from a previously read-in
initialization file), the \fIlatexmk\fR will delete this rule before
making the new one.

Suppose \fIlatexmk\fR is using this rule to convert a file
"figure.fig" to "figure.eps".  Then it will invoke the fig2eps
subroutine defined in the above code with a single argument "figure",
which is the basename of each of the files (possibly with a path
component).  This argument is referred to by \fIPerl\fR as $_[0].  In
the example above, the subroutine uses the \fIPerl\fR command system
to invoke the program fig2dev.  The double quotes around the string
are a \fIPerl\fR idiom that signify that each string of the form of a
variable name, $_[0] in this case, is to be substituted by its value.

If the return value of the subroutine is non-zero, then \fIlatexmk\fR
will assume an error occurred during the execution of the subroutine.
In the above example, no explicit return value is given, and instead
the return value is the value returned by the last (and only)
statement, i.e., the invocation of system, which returns the value 0
on success.

If you use \fIpdflatex\fR instead of latex, then you will probably prefer to
convert your graphics files to pdf format, in which case you would
replace the above code in an initialization file by

    add_cus_dep( 'fig', 'pdf, 0, 'fig2pdf' );
    sub fig2pdf {
        return system( "fig2dev -Lpdf \\"$_[0].fig\\" \\"$_[0].pdf\\"" ); 
    }

\fBNote 1:\fR In the command lines given in the system commands in the
above examples, double quotes have been inserted around the file names
(implemented by '\\"' in the Perl language).  They immunize the running
of the program against special characters in filenames.  Very often
these quotes are not necessary, i.e., they can be omitted.  But it is
normally safer to keep them in.  Even though the rules for quoting
vary between operating systems, command shells and individual pieces
of software, the quotes in the above examples do not cause problems in
the cases I have tested.

\fBNote 2:\fR One case in which the quotes are important is when the
files are in a subdirectory and your operating system is Microsoft
Windows.  Then the separator character for directory components can be
either a forward slash '/' or Microsoft's more usual backward slash
\'\\'.  Forward slashes are generated by \fIlatexmk\fR, to maintain its
sanity from software like MiKTeX that mixes both directory
separators; but their correct use normally requires quoted filenames. 
(See a log file from a run of MiKTeX (at least in v. 2.9) for an
example of the use of both directory separators.)

If you have some general custom dependencies defined in the system or
user initialization file, you may find that for a particular project
they are undesirable.  So you might want to delete the unneeded ones.
For example, you remove any "fig" to "eps" rule by the line

    remove_cus_dep( 'fig', 'eps' );

If you have complicated sets of custom dependencies, you may want to
get a listing of the custom dependencies.  This is done by using the
line 

    show_cus_dep();

in an initialization file. 

Another example of a custom dependency overcomes a limitation of
\fIlatexmk\fR concerning index files.  The only index-file conversion
built-in to \fIlatexmk\fR is from an ".idx" file written on one run of
latex/pdflatex to an ".ind" file to be read in on a subsequent run.
But with the index.sty package you can create extra indexes with
extensions that you configure.  \fILatexmk\fR does not know how to
deduce the extensions from the information it has.  But you can easily
write a custom dependency.  For example if your latex file uses the
command "\\newindex{special}{ndx}{nnd}{Special index}" you will need to
convert files with the extension \fI.ndx\fR to \fI.nnd\fR.  The
following lines in an initialization RC file will cause this to
happen: 

    add_cus_dep('ndx', 'nnd', 0, 'makendx2nnd');
    sub makendx2nnd {
        return system( "makeindex -o \\"$_[0].nnd\\" \\"$_[0].ndx\\"" );
    }

Those of you with experience with Makefiles, will undoubtedly be
concerned that the \fI.ndx\fR file is written during a run of
latex/pdflatex and is always later than the \fI.nnd\fR last read in.
Thus the \fI.nnd\fR appears to be perpetually out-of-date.  This
situation, of circular dependencies, is endemic to latex, and
\fIlatexmk\fR in its current version works correctly with circular
dependencies.  It examines the contents of the files (by use of an md5
checksum), and only does a remake when the file contents have actually
changed.

Of course if you choose to write random data to the \fI.nnd\fR (or the
\fI.aux\fR file, etc) that changes on each new run, then you will have
a problem.  For real experts: See the \fI%hash_cal_ignore_pattern\fR
if you have to deal with such problems.

Glossaries can be dealt with similarly.


.SH OLD METHOD OF DEFINING CUSTOM DEPENDENCIES
In previous versions of \fIlatexmk\fR, the only method of defining
custom dependencies was to directly manipulate the table of custom
dependencies.  This is contained in the \fB@cus_dep_list\fR array.  It
is an array of strings, and each string in the array has four items in
it, each separated by a space, the from-extension, the to-extension,
the "must" item, and the name of the subroutine for the custom
dependency.  These were all defined above.
.PP
An example of the old method of defining custom dependencies is as
follows. It is the code in an RC file to ensure automatic conversion
of \fI.fig\fR files to \fI.eps\fR files:

    push @cus_dep_list, "fig eps 0 fig2eps";
    sub fig2eps {
        return system( "fig2dev -Lps \\"$_[0].fig\\" \\"$_[0].eps\\"" );
    }

This method still works, and is equivalent to the earlier code using
the add_cus_dep subroutine, except that it doesn't delete any previous
custom-dependency for the same conversion.  So the new method is
preferable.


.SH ADVANCED CONFIGURATION: Some extra resources and advanced tricks

For most purposes, simple configuration for \fIlatexmk\fR along the
lines of the examples given is sufficient.  But sometimes you need
something harder.  In this section, I indicate some extra
possibilities.  Generally to use these, you need to be fluent in the
Perl language, since this is what is used in the rc files.

See also the section DEALING WITH ERRORS, PROBLEMS, ETC.  See
also the examples in the directory \fIexample_rcfiles\fR in the
\fIlatexmk\fR distributions.  Even if none of the examples apply to
your case, they may give ideas

.SS Variables and subroutines for processing a rule

A step in the processing is called a rule. One possibility to
implement the processing of a rule is by a Perl subroutine.  This is
always the case for custom dependencies. Also, for any other rule, you
can use a subroutine by prefixing the command specification by the
word "internal" -- see the section FORMAT OF COMMAND SPECIFICATIONS.

When you use a subroutine for processing a rule, all the possibilities
of Perl programming are available, of course.  In addition, some of
\fIlatexmk\fR's internal variables and subroutines are available.
The ones listed below are intended to be available to (advanced)
users, and their specifications will generally have stability under
upgrades. Generally, the variables should be treated as read-only:
Changing their values can have bad consequences, since it is liable to
mess up the consistency of what \fIlatexmk\fR is doing.

.TP
.B $rule
This variable has the name of the rule, as known to
\fIlatexmk\fR. Note that the exact contents of this variable for a
given rule may be dependent on the version of \fIlatexmk\fR

.TP
.B $$Psource
This gives the name of the primary source file.  Note the double
dollar signs.

.TP
.B $$Pdest
This gives the name of the main output file if any.  Note the double
dollar signs.

.TP
.B rdb_ensure_file( $rule, file )
This a subroutine that ensures that the given file is among the source
files for the specified rule.  It is typically used when, during the
processing of a rule, it is known that a particular extra file is
among the dependencies that \fIlatexmk\fR should know, but its default
methods don't find the dependency. Almost always the first argument is
the name of the rule currently being processed, so it is then
appropriate to specify it by \fB$rule\fR.

For examples of its use, see some of the files in the directory
\fIexample_rcfiles\fR of \fIlatexmk\fR's distribution.  Currently the
cases that use this subroutine are \fIexceltex_latexmkrc\fR and
\fItexinfo-latexmkrc\fR.  These illustrate typical cases where
\fIlatexmk\fR's normal processing fails to detect certain extra source
files. 

.TP
.B rdb_remove_files( $rule, file, ... )
This subroutine removes one or more files from the dependency list for
the given rule. 

.TP
.B rdb_list_source( $rule )
This subroutine returns the list of source files (i.e., the dependency
list) for the given rule. 

.TP
.B rdb_set_source( $rule, file, ... )
.B rdb_set_source( $rule, @files )
This subroutine sets the dependency list for the given rule to be the
specified files.  Files that are already in the list have unchanged
information.  Files that were not in the list are added to it.  Files
in the previous dependency list that are not in the newly specified
list of files are removed from the dependency list.


.SS Advanced configuration: Using \fIlatexmk\fB with \fImake\fR

This section is targeted only at advanced users who use the \fImake\fR
program for complex projects, as for software development, with the
dependencies specified by a Makefile.

Now the basic task of \fIlatexmk\fR is to run the appropriate programs
to make a viewable version of a LaTeX document.  However, the usual
\fImake\fR program is not suited to this purpose for at least two
reasons.  First is that the use of LaTeX involves circular
dependencies (e.g., via .aux files), and these cannot be handled by
the standard \fImake\fR program.  Second is that in a large document
the set of source files can change quite frequently, particularly with
included graphics files; in this situation keeping a Makefile manually
updated is inappropriate and error-prone, especially when the
dependencies can be determined automatically.  \fILatexmk\fR solves
both of these problems robustly.

Thus for many standard LaTeX documents \fIlatexmk\fR can be used by
itself without the \fImake\fR program.  In a complex project it simply
needs to be suitably configured.  A standard configuration would be to
define custom dependencies to make graphics files from their source
files (e.g., as created by the \fIxfig\fR program).  Custom
dependencies are \fIlatexmk\fR's equivalent of pattern rules in
Makefiles.

Nevertheless there are projects for which a Makefile is appropriate,
and it is useful to know how to use \fIlatexmk\fR from a Makefile.  A
typical example would be to generate documentation for a software
project.  Potentially the interaction with the rest of the rules in
the Makefile could be quite complicated, for example if some of the
source files for a LaTeX document are generated by the project's
software.

In this section, I give a couple of examples of how \fIlatexmk\fR can
be usefully invoked from a Makefile.  The examples use specific
features of current versions of GNU \fImake\fR, which is the default
on both linux and OS-X systems.  They may need modifications for other
versions of \fImake\fR.  

The simplest method is simply to delegate all the relevant tasks to
\fIlatexmk\fR, as is suitable for a straightforward LaTeX document.
For this a suitable Makefile is like

    .PHONY : FORCE_MAKE
    all : try.pdf
    %.pdf : %.tex FORCE_MAKE
        latexmk -pdf -dvi- -ps- $< 

(Note: the last line must be introduced by a tab for the Makefile to
function correctly!)  Naturally, if making try.pdf from its associated
LaTeX file try.tex were the only task to be performed, a direct use of
\fIlatexmk\fR without a Makefile would normally be better.  The
benefit of using a Makefile for a LaTeX document would be in a larger
project, where lines such as the above would be only be a small part
of a larger Makefile.

The above example has a pattern rule for making a .pdf file from 
a .tex file, and it is defined to use \fIlatexmk\fR in the obvious way.
There is a conventional default target named "all", with a
prerequisite of try.pdf.  So when \fImake\fR is invoked, by default it
makes try.pdf.  The only complication is that there may be many source
files beyond try.tex, but these aren't specified in the Makefile, so
changes in them will not by themselves cause \fIlatexmk\fR to be
invoked.  Instead, the pattern rule is equipped with a "phony"
prerequisite FORCE_MAKE; this has the effect of causing the rule to be
always out-of-date, so that \fIlatexmk\fR is always run.  It is
\fIlatexmk\fR that decides whether any action is needed, e.g., a rerun
of \fIpdflatex\fR.  Effectively the Makefile delegates all decisions
to \fIlatexmk\fR, while \fImake\fR has no knowledge of the list of
source files except for primary LaTeX file for the  document.  If
there are, for example, graphics files to be made, these must be
made by custom dependencies configured in \fIlatexmk\fR.

But something better is needed in more complicated situations, for
example, when the making of graphics files needs to be specified by
rules in the Makefile.  To do this, one can use a Makefile like the
following: 

     TARGETS = document1.pdf document2.pdf
     DEPS_DIR = .deps
     LATEXMK = latexmk -recorder -use-make -deps \\
           -e 'warn qq(In Makefile, turn off custom dependencies\\n);' \\
           -e '@cus_dep_list = ();' \\
           -e 'show_cus_dep();'
     all : $(TARGETS)
     $(foreach file,$(TARGETS),$(eval -include $(DEPS_DIR)/$(file)P))
     $(DEPS_DIR) :
            mkdir $@
     %.pdf : %.tex
            if [ ! -e $(DEPS_DIR) ]; then mkdir $(DEPS_DIR); fi
            $(LATEXMK) -pdf -dvi- -ps- -deps-out=$(DEPS_DIR)/$@P $< 
     %.pdf : %.fig
            fig2dev -Lpdf $< $@

(Again, the lines containing the commands for the rules should be
started with tabs.)  This example was inspired by how GNU
\fIautomake\fR handles automatic dependency tracking of C source
files.

After each run of \fIlatexmk\fR, dependency information is put in a file
in the .deps subdirectory.  The Makefile causes these dependency files
to be read by \fImake\fR, which now has the full dependency
information for each target .pdf file.  To make things less trivial it
is specificed that two files document1.pdf and document2.pdf are the
targets.  The dependency files are .deps/document1.pdfP 
and .deps/document2.pdfP.

There is now no need for the phony prerequisite for the rule to 
make .pdf files from .tex files.  But I have added a rule to 
make .pdf files from .fig files produced by the \fIxfig\fR program;
these are commonly used for graphics insertions in LaTeX documents.
\fILatexmk\fR is arranged to output a dependency file after each run.
It is given the \fB-recorder\fR option, which improves its detection
of files generated during a run of \fIpdflatex\fR; such files should
not be in the dependency list.  The \fB-e\fR options are used to turn
off all custom dependencies, and to document this.  Instead the
\fB-use-make\fR is used to delegate the making of missing files to
\fImake\fR itself.

Suppose in the LaTeX file there is a command \\includegraphics{graph},
and an \fIxfig\fR file "graph.fig" exists.  On a first run,
\fIpdflatex\fR reports a missing file, named "graph". \fILatexmk\fR
succeeds in making "graph.pdf" by calling "make graph.pdf", and after
completion of its work, it lists "fig.pdf" among the dependents of the
file \fIlatexmk\fR is making.  Then let "fig.fig" be updated, and then
let \fImake\fR be run.  \fIMake\fR first remakes "fig.pdf", and only
then reruns \fIlatexmk\fR.

Thus we now have a method by which all the subsidiary processing is
delegated to \fImake\fR.

.SH BUGS
Sometimes a viewer (gv) tries to read an updated .ps or .pdf file
after its creation is started but before the file is complete.  Work
around: manually refresh (or reopen) display.  Or use one of the other
previewers and update methods.  

(The following isn't really a bug, but concerns features of previewers.)
Preview continuous mode only works perfectly with certain previewers:
Xdvi on UNIX/Linux works for dvi files.  
Gv on UNIX/Linux works for both postscript and pdf.
Ghostview on UNIX/Linux needs a manual update (reopen); it views
postscript and pdf. 
Gsview under MS-Windows works for both postscript and pdf, 
but only reads the updated file when its screen is refreshed.
Acroread under UNIX/Linux views pdf, but the file needs to be closed
and reopened to view an updated version.
Under MS-Windows, acroread locks its input file and so the
pdf file cannot be updated.  (Remedy: configure \fIlatexmk\fR to use
\fIsumatrapdf\fR instead.)
