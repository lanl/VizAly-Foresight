NAME
       latexmk - generate LaTeX document

SYNOPSIS
       latexmk [options] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Latexmk completely automates the process of compiling a LaTeX document.
       Essentially, it is like a specialized  relative  of  the  general  make
       utility,  but  one  which determines dependencies automatically and has
       some other very useful  features.   In  its  basic  mode  of  operation
       latexmk  is  given  the name of the primary source file for a document,
       and it issues the appropriate sequence of commands to generate a  .dvi,
       .ps, .pdf and/or hardcopy version of the document.

       By  default  latexmk will run the commands necessary to generate a .dvi
       file.

       Latexmk can also be set to run continuously with a suitable  previewer.
       In  that  case  the  latex  program (or one of its relatives), etc, are
       rerun whenever one of the source files is modified, and  the  previewer
       automatically updates the on-screen view of the compiled document.

       Latexmk  determines  which  are  the  source files by examining the log
       file.  (Optionally, it also examines the list of input and output files
       generated  by  the  -recorder  option  of modern versions of latex (and
       pdflatex, xelatex, lualatex,  etc).   See  the  documentation  for  the
       -recorder  option  of latexmk below.)  When latexmk is run, it examines
       properties of the source files, and if any have been changed since  the
       last document generation, latexmk will run the various LaTeX processing
       programs as necessary.  In particular, it will repeat the run of  latex
       (or  a  related program)) often enough to resolve all cross references;
       depending on the macro packages used.  With  some  macro  packages  and
       document classes, four, or even more, runs may be needed. If necessary,
       latexmk will also run bibtex, biber, and/or  makeindex.   In  addition,
       latexmk can be configured to generate other necessary files.  For exam-
       ple, from an updated figure file it can automatically generate  a  file
       in  encapsulated  postscript  or another suitable format for reading by
       LaTeX.

       Latexmk has two different previewing  options.   With  the  simple  -pv
       option,  a  dvi, postscript or pdf previewer is automatically run after
       generating the dvi, postscript or pdf version  of  the  document.   The
       type  of  file  to view is selected according to configuration settings
       and command line options.

       The second previewing option is the  powerful  -pvc  option  (mnemonic:
       "preview continuously").  In this case, latexmk runs continuously, reg-
       ularly monitoring all the source files to  see  if  any  have  changed.
       Every  time  a change is detected, latexmk runs all the programs neces-
       sary to generate a new version of the document.  A good previewer  will
       then automatically update its display.  Thus the user can simply edit a
       file and, when the changes are  written  to  disk,  latexmk  completely
       automates  the  cycle  of  updating  the .dvi (and/or the .ps and .pdf)

       file, and refreshing the previewer's display.  It's not quite  WYSIWYG,
       but usefully close.

       For  other previewers, the user may have to manually make the previewer
       update its display, which can be (e.g., with some versions of xdvi  and
       gsview) as simple as forcing a redraw of its display.

       Latexmk  has  the  ability  to print a banner in gray diagonally across
       each page when making the postscript file.  It  can  also,  if  needed,
       call  an  external  program to do other postprocessing on generated dvi
       and postscript files.  (See the options -dF and -pF, and the documenta-
       tion  for  the  $dvi_filter  and  $ps_filter  configuration variables.)
       These capabilities are leftover from older versions of  latexmk.   More
       flexibility  can  be  obtained  in  current versions, since the command
       strings for running latex, pdflatex, etc can now be configured  to  run
       multiple commands.  This also extends the possibility of postprocessing
       generated files.

       Latexmk is highly configurable, both from the command line and in  con-
       figuration  files,  so  that  it can accommodate a wide variety of user
       needs and system configurations.  Default values are set  according  to
       the operating system, so latexmk often works without special configura-
       tion on MS-Windows, cygwin, Linux, OS-X, and other UNIX systems.

       A very annoying complication handled very reliably by latexmk, is  that
       LaTeX  is a multiple pass system.  On each run, LaTeX reads in informa-
       tion generated on a previous run, for things like cross referencing and
       indexing.   In  the simplest cases, a second run of LaTeX suffices, and
       often the log file contains a message about the need for another  pass.
       However,  there  is  a  wide variety of add-on macro packages to LaTeX,
       with a variety of behaviors.  The  result  is  to  break  simple-minded
       determinations  of  how  many  runs  are  needed and of which programs.
       Latexmk has a highly general and efficient solution  to  these  issues.
       The  solution involves retaining between runs information on the source
       files, and a symptom is that latexmk  generates  an  extra  file  (with
       extension  .fdb_latexmk,  by  default)  that  contains  the source file
       information.


LATEXMK OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS ON COMMAND LINE
       In general the command line to invoke latexmk has the form

            latexmk [options] [file]

       All options can be introduced by single or double "-" characters, e.g.,
       "latexmk -help" or "latexmk --help".

       Note  1:  In  addition to the options in the list below, latexmk recog-
       nizes almost all the options recognized by the latex, pdflatex programs
       (and  their  relatives) in their current TeXLive and MiKTeX implementa-
       tions.  Some of the options for these  programs  also  trigger  special
       action  or behavior by latexmk, in which case they have specific expla-
       nations in this document.  Otherwise, they are just passed through to a
       called    latex   or   pdflatex   program.   Run   latexmk   with   the



                                19 January 2017                              2





LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


       -showextraoptions to get a list of the options that latexmk accepts and
       that  are  simply  passed through to latex or pdflatex (etc).  See also
       the explanation of the -showextraoptions option for more information.

       Note 2: In this documentation, the program pdflatex is  often  referred
       to.   Users of programs like lualatex and xelatex should know that from
       latexmk's point of view, these other programs behave very  like  pdfla-
       tex,  i.e.,  they  make  a  pdf file from a tex file, etc.  So whenever
       pdflatex is mentioned without mention of the other programs, the state-
       ments  apply  equally  to lualatex, xelatex, and any other similar pro-
       grams.  Latexmk can be easily configured to use whichever of these pro-
       grams  is  needed.   See  the  documentation for the following options:
       -pdflua, -pdfxe, -lualatex, and -xelatex, and also see  the  documenta-
       tion  for  the  $pdflatex,  $lualatex, and $xelatex configuration vari-
       ables.  At present latexmk does not do  automatic  detection  of  which
       program is to be used.


       Definitions of options and arguments


       file   One  or more files can be specified.  If no files are specified,
              latexmk will, by default, run on all files in the current  work-
              ing  directory  with  a  ".tex" extension.  This behavior can be
              changed: see the description concerning the @default_files vari-
              able  in  the section "List of configuration variables usable in
              initialization files".

              If a file is specified without an  extension,  then  the  ".tex"
              extension  is automatically added, just as LaTeX does.  Thus, if
              you specify:

                   latexmk foo

              then latexmk will operate on the file "foo.tex".


       -auxdir=FOO or -aux-directory=FOO
              Sets the directory for  auxiliary  output  files  of  (pdf)latex
              (.aux,  .log  etc).  This achieves its effect by the -aux-direc-
              tory option of (pdf)latex, which currently is  only  implemented
              on the MiKTeX version of (pdf)latex.

              See   also   the   -outdir/-output-directory  options,  and  the
              $aux_dir,  $out_dir,  and  $search_path_separator  configuration
              variables  of  latexmk.  In particular, see the documentation of
              $out_dir for some complications  on  what  directory  names  are
              suitable.

              If you also use the -cd option, and the specified auxiliary out-
              put directory is a relative path, then the path  is  interpreted
              relative to the document directory.





                                19 January 2017                              3





LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


       -bibtex
              When the source file uses bbl files for bibliography, run bibtex
              or biber as needed to regenerate the bbl files.

              This property can also be configured by setting the  $bibtex_use
              variable to 2 in a configuration file


       -bibtex-
              Never run bibtex or biber.

              A  common  use  for this option is when a document comes from an
              external source, complete with its bbl  file(s),  and  the  user
              does  not  have  the corresponding bib files available.  In this
              situation use of the -bibtex- option will prevent  latexmk  from
              trying to run bibtex or biber, which would result in overwriting
              of the bbl files.


       -bibtex-cond
              When the source file uses bbl file(s) for the bibliography,  run
              bibtex  or biber as needed to regenerate the bbl files, but only
              if the relevant bib file(s) exist.  Thus when the bib files  are
              not  available,  bibtex  or  biber  is not run, thereby avoiding
              overwriting of the bbl file(s).  This is the default setting.

              (Note that it is possible for latexmk to  decide  that  the  bib
              file  does  not  exist,  even though the bib file does exist and
              bibtex or biber finds it.  The problem is that the bib file  may
              not  be  in  the  current directory but in some search path; the
              places latexmk and bibtex or biber cause to be searched need not
              be  identical.   On modern installations of TeX and related pro-
              grams this problem should not  arise,  since  latexmk  uses  the
              kpsewhich program to do the search, and kpsewhich should use the
              same search path as bibtex and biber.  If this  problem  arises,
              use the -bibtex option when invoking latexmk.)


       -bm <message>
              A  banner message to print diagonally across each page when con-
              verting the dvi file to postscript.  The message must be a  sin-
              gle argument on the command line so be careful with quoting spa-
              ces and such.

              Note that if the -bm option is  specified,  the  -ps  option  is
              assumed.


       -bi <intensity>
              How  dark to print the banner message.  A decimal number between
              0 and 1.  0 is black and 1 is white.  The default is 0.95, which
              is OK unless your toner cartridge is getting low.





                                19 January 2017                              4





LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


       -bs <scale>
              A  decimal  number  that  specifies how large the banner message
              will be printed.  Experimentation is necessary to get the  right
              scale  for  your message, as a rule of thumb the scale should be
              about equal to 1100 divided by the number of characters  in  the
              message.  The default is 220.0 which is just right for 5 charac-
              ter messages.


       -commands
              List the commands used by latexmk for processing files, and then
              exit.


       -c     Clean up (remove) all regeneratable files generated by latex and
              bibtex or biber except dvi, postscript and pdf.  These files are
              a  combination  of log files, aux files, latexmk's database file
              of source file information, and those with extensions  specified
              in  the  @generated_exts  configuration  variable.  In addition,
              files specified by the  $clean_ext  configuration  variable  are
              removed.

              This  cleanup  is instead of a regular make.  See the -gg option
              if you want to do a cleanup then a make.

              If $bibtex_use is set to 0 or 1, bbl files are counted  as  non-
              regeneratable.

              If  $cleanup_includes_cusdep_generated is nonzero, regeneratable
              files are considered as  including  those  generated  by  custom
              dependencies  and  are  also deleted.  Otherwise these files are
              not deleted.


       -C     Clean up (remove) all regeneratable files generated by latex and
              bibtex  or  biber.   This  is the same as the -c option with the
              addition of dvi, postscript and pdf files, and  those  specified
              in the $clean_full_ext configuration variable.

              This  cleanup  is instead of a regular make.  See the -gg option
              if you want to do a cleanup than a make.

              If $bibtex_use is set to 0 or 1, bbl files are counted  as  non-
              regeneratable.

              If  $cleanup_includes_cusdep_generated is nonzero, regeneratable
              files are considered as  including  those  generated  by  custom
              dependencies  and  are  also deleted.  Otherwise these files are
              not deleted.


       -CA    (Obsolete).  Now equivalent to the -C option.  See  that  option
              for details.




                                19 January 2017                              5





LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


       -cd    Change  to  the directory containing the main source file before
              processing it.  Then all the generated  files  (aux,  log,  dvi,
              pdf, etc) will be relative to the source file.

              This  option is particularly useful when latexmk is invoked from
              a GUI configured to invoke latexmk with a full pathname for  the
              source file.


       -cd-   Do  NOT  change to the directory containing the main source file
              before processing it.  Then all the generated files  (aux,  log,
              dvi,  pdf, etc) will be relative to the current directory rather
              than the source file.

              This is the default behavior and corresponds to the behavior  of
              the  latex  and pdflatex programs.  However, it is not desirable
              behavior when latexmk is invoked by a GUI configured  to  invoke
              latexmk  with  a full pathname for the source file.  See the -cd
              option.


       -CF    Remove the file containing the database of source file  informa-
              tion, before doing the other actions requested.


       -d     Set  draft  mode.  This prints the banner message "DRAFT" across
              your page when converting the dvi file to postscript.  Size  and
              intensity can be modified with the -bs and -bi options.  The -bm
              option will override this option as this is really just a  short
              way of specifying:

                   latexmk -bm DRAFT

              Note  that  if  the  -d  option  is specified, the -ps option is
              assumed.


       -deps  Show a list of dependent files after processing.  This is in the
              form  of a dependency list of the form used by the make program,
              and it is therefore suitable for use in a Makefile.  It gives an
              overall view of the files without listing intermediate files, as
              well as latexmk can determine them.

              By default the list of dependent files is sent to stdout  (i.e.,
              normally  to  the screen unless you've redirected latexmk's out-
              put). But you can set the filename where the list is sent by the
              -deps-out= option.

              See  the section "USING latexmk WITH make" for an example of how
              to use a dependency list with make.

              Users familiar with GNU automake and  gcc  will  find  that  the
              -deps  option  is very similar in its purpose and results to the
              -M option to gcc.  (In fact, latexmk also has options  -M,  -MF,



                                19 January 2017                              6

              and -MP options that behave like those of gcc.)


       -dependents
              Equivalent to -deps.


       -deps- Do  not  show a list of dependent files after processing.  (This
              is the default.)


       -dependents-
              Equivalent to -deps-.


       -deps-out=FILENAME
              Set the filename to which the list of dependent files  is  writ-
              ten.   If  the  FILENAME argument is omitted or set to "-", then
              the output is sent to stdout.

              Use of this option also turns on  the  output  of  the  list  of
              dependent files after processing.


       -dF    Dvi  file  filtering.   The  argument to this option is a filter
              which will generate a  filtered  dvi  file  with  the  extension
              ".dviF".   All  extra processing (e.g. conversion to postscript,
              preview, printing) will then be performed on this  filtered  dvi
              file.

              Example usage: To use dviselect to select only the even pages of
              the dvi file:

                   latexmk -dF "dviselect even" foo.tex


       -diagnostics
              Print detailed diagnostics during a  run.   This  may  help  for
              debugging problems or to understand latexmk's behavior in diffi-
              cult situations.


       -dvi   Generate dvi version of document.


       -dvi-  Turn off generation of dvi version of document.  (This  may  get
              overridden,  if  some other file is made (e.g., a .ps file) that
              is generated from the dvi file, or if no generated file  at  all
              is requested.)


       -e <code>
              Execute  the  specified  initialization  code before processing.
              The code is Perl code of the same form as is used  in  latexmk's

              initialization  files.  For more details, see the information on
              the -r option, and the section about  "Configuration/initializa-
              tion  (RC)  files".  The code is typically a sequence of assign-
              ment statements separated by semicolons.

              The code is executed when the -e option  is  encountered  during
              latexmk's  parsing of its command line.  See the -r option for a
              way of executing initialization code  from  a  file.   An  error
              results  in  latexmk stopping.  Multiple instances of the -r and
              -e options can be used, and they are executed in the order  they
              appear on the command line.

              Some care is needed to deal with proper quoting of special char-
              acters in the code on the command line.   For  example,  suppose
              you  want  to  set  the  latex  command to use its -shell-escape
              option, then under UNIX/Linux you could use the line

                   latexmk -e '$latex=q/latex %O -shell-escape %S/' file.tex

              Note that the single  quotes  block  normal  UNIX/Linux  command
              shells  from  treating  the characters inside the quotes as spe-
              cial.  (In this example, the q/.../ construct is  a  Perl  idiom
              equivalent  to  using  single quotes.  This avoids the complica-
              tions of getting a quote  character  inside  an  already  quoted
              string  in  a  way that is independent of both the shell and the
              operating-system.)

              The above command line  will  NOT  work  under  MS-Windows  with
              cmd.exe  or  command.com  or 4nt.exe.  For MS-Windows with these
              command shells you could use

                   latexmk -e "$latex=q/latex %O -shell-escape %S/" file.tex

              or

                   latexmk -e "$latex='latex %O -shell-escape %S'" file.tex

              The last two examples will  NOT  work  with  UNIX/Linux  command
              shells.

              (Note:  the above examples show are to show how to use the -e to
              specify initialization code to be executed.  But the  particular
              effect can be achieved also by the use of the -latex option with
              less problems in dealing with quoting.)


       -f     Force latexmk to continue document  processing  despite  errors.
              Normally, when latexmk detects that LaTeX or another program has
              found an error which will not be resolved by further processing,
              no further processing is carried out.

              Note:  "Further  processing" means the running of other programs
              or the rerunning of latex (etc) that would be done if no  errors
              had  occurred.   If instead, or additionally, you want the latex

              (etc) program not to pause for user input after  an  error,  you
              should  arrange this by an option that is passed to the program,
              e.g., by latexmk's option -interaction=nonstopmode.


       -f-    Turn off the forced processing-past-errors such as is set by the
              -f  option.   This could be used to override a setting in a con-
              figuration file.


       -g     Force latexmk to process document fully, even  under  situations
              where  latexmk  would  normally  decide  that  no changes in the
              source files have occurred since the previous run.  This  option
              is  useful,  for example, if you change some options and wish to
              reprocess the files.


       -g-    Turn off -g.


       -gg    "Super go mode" or "clean make": clean out generated files as if
              -C had been given, and then do a regular make.


       -h, -help
              Print help information.


       -jobname=STRING
              Set  the  basename  of output files(s) to STRING, instead of the
              default, which is the basename of the specified TeX file.

              This is like the same option for current implementations of  the
              latex,  pdflatex,  etc,  and the passing of this option to these
              programs is part of latexmk's implementation of -jobname.


       -l     Run in landscape mode, using the landscape mode for the preview-
              ers  and  the  dvi to postscript converters.  This option is not
              normally needed  nowadays,  since  current  previewers  normally
              determine this information automatically.


       -l-    Turn off -l.


       -latex="COMMAND"
              This sets the string specifying the command to run latex, and is
              typically used to add desired options.  Since  the  string  nor-
              mally contains spaces, it should be quoted, e.g.,

                   latexmk -latex="latex --shell-escape %O %S"  foo.tex

              The  specification of the contents of the string are the same as

              for the $latex configuration variable.  Depending on your  oper-
              ating  system  and the command-line shell you are using, you may
              need to change the single quotes to double quotes (or  something
              else).

              To set the command for running pdflatex (rather than the command
              for latex) see the -pdflatex option.


       -logfilewarninglist
              -logfilewarnings After a run of (pdf)latex, give a list of warn-
              ings  about  undefined  citations  and references (unless silent
              mode is on).

              See also the $silence_logfile_warnings configuration variable.


       -logfilewarninglist-
              -logfilewarnings- After a run of (pdf)latex, do not give a  list
              of warnings about undefined citations and references.  (Default)

              See also the $silence_logfile_warnings configuration variable.


       -lualatex
              Use  lualatex.   That  is,  use  lualatex  to process the source
              file(s) to pdf.  The generation of dvi and postscript  files  is
              turned off.

              This option is equivalent to using the following set of options

                   -pdflua -dvi- -ps-

              (Note:  Note  that  the method of implementation of this option,
              but not its intended effect, differ from some  earlier  versions
              of latexmk.)


       -M     Show  list of dependent files after processing.  This is equiva-
              lent to the -deps option.


       -MF file
              If a list of dependents is made, the -MF specifies the  file  to
              write it to.


       -MP    If a list of dependents is made, include a phony target for each
              source file.  If you use the dependents list in a Makefile,  the
              dummy  rules  work  around  errors the program make gives if you
              remove header files without updating the Makefile to match.

LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


       -new-viewer
              When in continuous-preview mode, always start a  new  viewer  to
              view  the generated file.  By default, latexmk will, in continu-
              ous-preview mode, test for a previously  running  previewer  for
              the same file and not start a new one if a previous previewer is
              running.  However, its test sometimes fails (notably if there is
              an  already-running previewer that is viewing a file of the same
              name as the current file, but in a different  directory).   This
              option turns off the default behavior.


       -new-viewer-
              The  inverse  of the -new-viewer option.  It puts latexmk in its
              normal behavior that in preview-continuous mode it checks for an
              already-running previewer.


       -nobibtex
              Never run bibtex or biber.  Equivalent to the -bibtex- option.


       -norc  Turn off the automatic reading of initialization (rc) files.

              N.B.  Normally the initialization files are read and obeyed, and
              then command line options are  obeyed  in  the  order  they  are
              encountered.   But  -norc  is  an  exception to this rule: it is
              acted on first, no matter where it occurs on the command line.


       -outdir=FOO or -output-directory=FOO

              Sets the directory for the output  files  of  (pdf)latex.   This
              achieves   its   effect   by  the  -output-directory  option  of
              (pdf)latex, which currently (Dec. 2011 and later) is implemented
              on  the common versions of (pdf)latex, i.e., MiKTeX and TeXLive.
              It may not be present in other versions.

              See also the -auxdir/-aux-directory options, and  the  $aux_dir,
              $out_dir,  and $search_path_separator configuration variables of
              latexmk.  In particular, see the documentation of  $out_dir  for
              some complications on what directory names are suitable.

              If  you also use the -cd option, and the specified output direc-
              tory is a relative path, then the path is  interpreted  relative
              to the document directory.


       -p     Print  out  the  document.  By default the file to be printed is
              the first in the list postscript, pdf, dvi that is  being  made.
              But you can use the -print=... option to change the type of file
              to be printed, and you can configure this in a start up file (by
              setting the $print_type variable).

              However,  printing  is  enabled by default only under UNIX/Linux



                                19 January 2017                             11

              systems, where the default is to use the lpr command and only on
              postscript files.  In general, the correct behavior for printing
              very much depends on your  system's  software.   In  particular,
              under  MS-Windows  you  must have suitable program(s) available,
              and you must have configured the print commands used by latexmk.
              This  can  be  non-trivial.   See the documentation on the $lpr,
              $lpr_dvi, and $lpr_pdf configuration variables to see how to set
              the commands for printing.

              This option is incompatible with the -pv and -pvc options, so it
              turns them off.


       -pdf   Generate pdf version of document using pdflatex.  (If  you  wish
              to use lualatex or xelatex, you can use whichever of the options
              -pdflua, -pdfxe, -lualatex or -xelatex applies.)   To  configure
              latexmk  to  have  such  behavior by default, see the section on
              "Configuration/initialization (rc) files".


       -pdfdvi
              Generate pdf version of document from the dvi file,  by  default
              using dvipdf.


       -pdflua
              Generate pdf version of document using lualatex.


       -pdfps Generate  pdf  version  of document from the ps file, by default
              using ps2pdf.


       -pdfxe Generate pdf version of document using xelatex.   Note  that  to
              optimize  processing  time,  latexmk uses xelatex to generate an
              xdv file rather than a pdf file directly.  Only  after  possibly
              multiple  runs  to  generate a fully up-to-date xdv does latexmk
              then call xdvipdfmx to generate the final pdf file.

              (Note: When the document includes large  graphics  files,  espe-
              cially  png  files,  the  last step can be quite time consuming,
              even when the creation of the xdv file by xelatex is  fast.   So
              the  use  of the intermediate xdv file can result in substantial
              gains in procesing time, since the pdf  file  is  produced  once
              rather than on every run of xelatex.)


       -pdf-  Turn  off  generation  of pdf version of document.  (This can be
              used to override a setting in a configuration file.  It may  get
              overridden if some other option requires the generation of a pdf
              file.)






                                19 January 2017                             12





LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


       -pdflatex="COMMAND"
              This sets the string specifying the command to run pdflatex, and
              is typically used to add desired options.  Since the string nor-
              mally contains spaces, it should be quoted, e.g.,

                   latexmk  -pdf  -pdflatex="pdflatex  --shell-escape  %O  %S"
              foo.tex

              The  specification of the contents of the string are the same as
              for the $pdflatex configuration  variable.   Depending  on  your
              operating  system  and the command-line shell you are using, you
              may need to change the single quotes to double quotes (or  some-
              thing else).

              To  set  the  command for running latex (rather than the command
              for pdflatex) see the -latex option.


       -print=dvi, -print=ps, -print=pdf, -print=auto,
              Define which kind of file is printed.  This option also  ensures
              that the requisite file is made, and turns on printing.

              The (default) case -print=auto determines the kind of print file
              automatically from the set of files that  is  being  made.   The
              first  in  the list postscript, pdf, dvi that is among the files
              to be made is the one used for print out.


       -ps    Generate postscript version of document.


       -ps-   Turn off generation of postscript version of document.  This can
              be  used to override a setting in a configuration file.  (It may
              get overridden by some other option that requires  a  postscript
              file, for example a request for printing.)


       -pF    Postscript  file  filtering.   The  argument to this option is a
              filter which will generate a filtered postscript file  with  the
              extension ".psF".  All extra processing (e.g. preview, printing)
              will then be performed on this filtered postscript file.

              Example of usage: Use psnup to print two pages on the one page:

                   latexmk -ps -pF 'psnup -2' foo.tex

              or

                   latexmk -ps -pF "psnup -2" foo.tex

              Whether to use single or double quotes round the "psnup -2" will
              depend  on  your  command interpreter, as used by the particular
              version of perl and the operating system on your computer.

LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


       -pv    Run file previewer.  If the -view  option  is  used,  this  will
              select  the kind of file to be previewed (dvi, ps or pdf).  Oth-
              erwise the viewer views the "highest" kind of file selected,  by
              the  -dvi,  -ps, -pdf, -pdfps options, in the order dvi, ps, pdf
              (low to high).  If no file type has been selected, the dvi  pre-
              viewer  will  be  used.  This option is incompatible with the -p
              and -pvc options, so it turns them off.


       -pv-   Turn off -pv.


       -pvc   Run a file previewer  and  continually  update  the  .dvi,  .ps,
              and/or .pdf files whenever changes are made to source files (see
              the Description above).  Which of these files is  generated  and
              which  is  viewed  is  governed by the other options, and is the
              same as for the -pv option.  The preview-continuous option  -pvc
              can  only work with one file.  So in this case you will normally
              only specify one filename on  the  command  line.   It  is  also
              incompatible  with  the  -p  and  -pv options, so it turns these
              options off.

              The -pvc option also turns off force mode (-f), as  is  normally
              best  for  continuous  preview  mode.   If you really want force
              mode, use the options in the order -pvc -f.

              With a good previewer the display will be automatically updated.
              (Under  some but not all versions of UNIX/Linux "gv -watch" does
              this for postscript files; this can be set  by  a  configuration
              variable.   This  would  also  work  for pdf files except for an
              apparent bug in gv that causes an error when the  newly  updated
              pdf  file  is  read.)   Many other previewers will need a manual
              update.

              Important note: the acroread program on MS-Windows locks the pdf
              file,  and  prevents  new versions being written, so it is a bad
              idea to use acroread to view  pdf  files  in  preview-continuous
              mode.   It  is  better to use a different viewer: SumatraPDF and
              gsview are good possibilities.

              There are some other methods for arranging  an  update,  notably
              useful  for  many versions of xdvi and xpdf.  These are best set
              in latexmk's configuration; see below.

              Note that if latexmk  dies  or  is  stopped  by  the  user,  the
              "forked" previewer will continue to run.  Successive invocations
              with the -pvc option will not fork new previewers,  but  latexmk
              will  normally  use the existing previewer.  (At least this will
              happen when latexmk is running under an operating  system  where
              it  knows how to determine whether an existing previewer is run-

              Turn off -pvc.


       -quiet Same as -silent


       -r <rcfile>
              Read the specified initialization file ("RC file")  before  pro-
              cessing.

              Be careful about the ordering: (1) Standard initialization files
              -- see the section below on  "Configuration/initialization  (RC)
              files"  --  are read first.  (2) Then the options on the command
              line are acted on in the order they are given.  Therefore if  an
              initialization  file  is  specified by the -r option, it is read
              during this second step.  Thus an initialization file  specified
              with the -r option can override both the standard initialization
              files and previously specified options.  But all of these can be
              overridden by later options.

              The contents of the RC file just comprise a piece of code in the
              Perl programming language (typically a  sequence  of  assignment
              statements); they are executed when the -r option is encountered
              during latexmk's parsing of its command line.  See the -e option
              for  a  way  of giving initialization code directly on latexmk's
              command line.  An error results in latexmk  stopping.   Multiple
              instances  of  the  -r  and -e options can be used, and they are
              executed in the order they appear on the command line.


       -recorder
              Give the -recorder option with latex and  pdflatex.   In  (most)
              modern  versions  of  these  programs, this results in a file of
              extension .fls containing a list of the files  that  these  pro-
              grams have read and written.  Latexmk will then use this file to
              improve its detection of source files and generated files  after
              a  run  of  latex  or  pdflatex.  This is the default setting of
              latexmk, unless overridden in an initialization file.

              For further information, see the documentation for the $recorder
              configuration variable.


       -recorder-
              Do not supply the -recorder option with latex and pdflatex.


       -rules Show a list of latemk's rules and dependencies after processing.


       -rules-
              Do  not  show  a  list of latexmk's rules and dependencies after
              processing.  (This is the default.)

LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


       -showextraoptions
              Show the list of extra latex and pdflatex options  that  latexmk
              recognizes,  but  that  it simply passes through to the programs
              latex, pdflatex, etc  when they  are  run.   These  options  are
              (currently)  a  combination  of those allowed by the TeXLive and
              MiKTeX implementations.  (If a particular  option  is  given  to
              latexmk  but  is not handled by the particular implementation of
              latex or pdflatex that is being used, that program will probably
              give  an  error  message.)  These options are very numerous, but
              are not listed in this documentation because they have no effect
              on latexmk's actions.

              There  are  a  few  options (-includedirectory=dir, -initialize,
              -ini) that are not recognized, either  because  they  don't  fit
              with latexmk's intended operations, or because they need special
              processing by latexmk that  isn't  implemented  (at  least,  not
              yet).

              There  are  also  options  that  are  accepted by latex etc, but
              instead trigger actions by latexmk: -help, -version.

              Finally, there are certain options for latex and pdflatex (e.g.,
              -recorder)  that  trigger special actions or behavior by latexmk
              itself as well as being passed in some form to the called  latex
              and  pdflatex  program,  or  that affect other programs as well.
              These options do have  entries  in  this  documentation.   These
              options are: -jobname=STRING, -aux-directory=dir, -output-direc-
              tory=DIR, -quiet, and -recorder.


       -silent
              Run commands silently, i.e., with options that reduce the amount
              of  diagnostics  generated.   For example, with the default set-
              tings, the command "latex -interaction=batchmode"  is  used  for
              (pdf)latex and friends.

              See   also   the  -logfilewarninglist  and  -logfilewarninglist-
              options.

              Also reduce the number of informational  messages  that  latexmk
              itself generates.

              To  change  the  options used to make the commands run silently,
              you need to configure latexmk with changed values of its config-
              uration    variables,    the    relevant    ones   being   $bib-
              tex_silent_switch, $biber_silent_switch,  $dvipdf_silent_switch,
              $dvips_silent_switch,        $latex_silent_switch,       $luala-
              tex_silent_switch       $makeindex_silent_switch,        $pdfla-
              tex_silent_switch, and $xelatex_silent_switch


       -time  Show  CPU  time  used.   See  also  the  configuration  variable
              $show_time.




                                19 January 2017                             16





LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


       -time- Do not show CPU time used.  See also the configuration  variable
              $show_time.


       -use-make
              When  after a run of latex or pdflatex, there are warnings about
              missing files (e.g., as requested by the LaTeX \input, \include,
              and  \includgraphics  commands), latexmk tries to make them by a
              custom dependency. If no  relevant  custom  dependency  with  an
              appropriate source file is found, and if the -use-make option is
              set, then as a last resort latexmk will try to use the make pro-
              gram to try to make the missing files.

              Note  that  the  filename may be specified without an extension,
              e.g., by \includegraphics{drawing} in a  LaTeX  file.   In  that
              case,  latexmk  will try making drawing.ext with ext set in turn
              to the possible extensions that are relevant for  latex  (or  as
              appropriate pdflatex).

              See  also  the documentation for the $use_make_for_missing_files
              configuration variable.


       -use-make-
              Do not use the make  program  to  try  to  make  missing  files.
              (Default.)


       -v, -version
              Print version number of latexmk.


       -verbose
              Opposite of -silent.  This is the default setting.


       -view=default, -view=dvi, -view=ps, -view=pdf, -view=none
              Set the kind of file used when previewing is requested (e.g., by
              the -pv or -pvc switches).  The default is to view the "highest"
              kind of requested file (in the low-to-high order dvi, ps, pdf).

              Note  the  possibility  -view=none  where no viewer is opened at
              all.  One example of is use is  in  conjunction  with  the  -pvc
              option,  when you want latexmk to do a compilation automatically
              whenever source file(s) change, but do not want a  previewer  to
              be opened.


       -xelatex
              Use xelatex.  That is, use xelatex to process the source file(s)
              to pdf.  The generation of dvi and postscript  files  is  turned
              off.

              This option is equivalent to using the following set of options



                                19 January 2017                             17





LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


                   -pdfxe -dvi- -ps-

              [Note:  Note  that  the method of implementation of this option,
              but not its intended primary effect, differ  from  some  earlier
              versions  of  latexmk. Latexmk first uses xelatex to make an xdv
              file, and does all the extra runs  needed  (including  those  of
              bibtex,  etc).   Only  after that does it make the pdf file from
              the xdv file, using xdvipdfmx.  This  procedure  can  result  in
              considerable  savings  in run time, since the xdv-to-pdf conver-
              sion is quite time-consuming when large graphics files are  used
              in the document.]



       Compatibility between options

       The  preview-continuous option -pvc can only work with one file.  So in
       this case you will normally only specify one filename  on  the  command
       line.

       Options  -p,  -pv  and  -pvc  are mutually exclusive.  So each of these
       options turns the others off.


EXAMPLES
       % latexmk thesis    # run latex enough times to resolve
                           cross-references

       % latexmk -pvc -ps thesis# run latex enough times to resolve
                           cross-references, make a postscript
                           file, start a previewer.  Then
                           watch for changes in the source
                           file thesis.tex and any files it
                           uses.  After any changes rerun latex
                           the appropriate number of times and
                           remake the postscript file.  If latex
                           encounters an error, latexmk will
                           keep running, watching for
                           source file changes.

       % latexmk -c        # remove .aux, .log, .bbl, .blg, .dvi,
                           .pdf, .ps & .bbl files



DEALING WITH ERRORS, PROBLEMS, ETC
       Some possibilities:

       a. If you get a strange error, do look carefully at the output that  is
       on  the  screen  and in log files.  While there is much that is notori-
       ously verbose in the output of latex (and that is added to by latexmk),
       the  verbosity  is  there  for a reason: to enable the user to diagnose
       problems.  Latexmk does repeat some messages at the end of a  run  that
       it  thinks  would  otherwise  be  easy  to  miss in the middle of other



                                19 January 2017                             18

       output.

       b. Generally, remember that latexmk does its work by running other pro-
       grams.  Your first priority in dealing with errors should be to examine
       what went wrong with the individual programs.  Then you need to correct
       the  causes of errors in the runs of these programs.  (Often these come
       from errors in the source document, but they could also be about  miss-
       ing LaTeX packages, etc.)

       c. If latexmk doesn't run the programs the way you would like, then you
       need to look in this documentation at the list of command line  options
       and  then at the sections on configuration/initialization files.  A lot
       of latexmk's behavior is configurable to deal  with  particular  situa-
       tions.  (But there is a lot of reading!)

       The  remainder  of  these notes consists of ideas for dealing with more
       difficult situations.

       d. Further tricks can involve  replacing  the  standard  commands  that
       latexmk runs by other commands or scripts.

       e.  For possible examples of code for use in an RC file, see the direc-
       tory  example_rcfiles  in  the  distribution  of  latexmk   (e.g.,   at
       http://mirror.ctan.org/support/latexmk/example_rcfiles).  Even if these
       examples don't do what you want, they may provide suitable inspiration.

       f. There's a useful trick that  can  be  used  when  you  use  lualatex
       instead  of  pdflatex (and in some related situations).  The problem is
       that latexmk won't notice a dependency on a file, bar.baz say, that  is
       input  by  the  lua code in your document instead of by the LaTeX part.
       (Thus if you change bar.baz and rerun latexmk, then latexmk will  think
       no  files  have  changed  and  not  rerun  lualatex, whereas if you had
       '\input{bar.baz}' in the LaTeX part  of  the  document,  latexmk  would
       notice  the  change.)   One solution is just to put the following some-
       where in the LaTeX part of the document:

                     \typeout{(bar.baz)}

       This puts a line in the log file that latexmk will  treat  as  implying
       that  the  file  bar.baz  was  read.  (At present I don't know a way of
       doing this automatically.)  Of course, if  the  file  has  a  different
       name, change bar.baz to the name of your file.

       g. See also the section ADVANCED CONFIGURATION: Some extra resources.

       h.    Look   on   tex.stackexchange,   i.e.,   at   http://tex.stackex-
       change.com/questions/tagged/latexmk  Someone may  have  already  solved
       your problem.

LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


CONFIGURATION/INITIALIZATION (RC) FILES
       Latexmk can be customized using initialization files, which are read at
       startup in the following order:

       1) The system RC file, if it exists.
          On a UNIX system, latexmk searches for following places for its sys-
       tem RC file, in the following order, and reads the first it finds:
          "/opt/local/share/latexmk/LatexMk",
          "/usr/local/share/latexmk/LatexMk",
          "/usr/local/lib/latexmk/LatexMk".
          On a MS-Windows system it looks for "C:\latexmk\LatexMk".
          On a cygwin system (i.e., a MS-Windows system in which Perl is  that
       of cygwin), latexmk reads the first it finds of
          "/cygdrive/c/latexmk/LatexMk",
          "/opt/local/share/latexmk/LatexMk",
          "/usr/local/share/latexmk/LatexMk",
          "/usr/local/lib/latexmk/LatexMk".

       In addition, it then tries the same set of locations, but with the file
       name replaced "LatexMk" replaced by "latexmkrc".

       2) The user's RC file, if it exists.  This can be in one of two places.
       The  traditional one is ".latexmkrc" in the user's home directory.  The
       other possibility is "latexmk/latexmkrc" in the user's  XDG  configura-
       tion  home  directory.  The actual file read is the first of "$XDG_CON-
       FIG_HOME/latexmk/latexmkrc" or "$HOME/.latexmkrc" which  exists.   (See
       https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-lat-
       est.html for details on the XDG Base Directory Specification.)

       Here $HOME is the  user's  home  directory.   [Latexmk  determines  the
       user's  home  directory as follows:  It is the value of the environment
       variable HOME, if this variable exists, which normally is the  case  on
       UNIX-like  systems  (including Linux and OS-X).  Otherwise the environ-
       ment variable USERPROFILE is used, if it exists, which normally is  the
       case on MS-Windows systems. Otherwise a blank string is used instead of
       $HOME, in which case latexmk does not look for an RC file in it.]

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is the value  of  the  environment  variable  XDG_CON-
       FIG_HOME  if  it  exists.  If this environment variable does not exist,
       but $HOME is non-blank, then $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is  set  to  the  default
       value  of  $HOME/.config.   Otherwise  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME  is  blank, and
       latexmk does not look for an RC file under it.


       3) The RC file in the current working  directory.   This  file  can  be
       named  either "latexmkrc" or ".latexmkrc", and the first of these to be
       found is used, if any.

       4) Any RC file(s) specified on the command line with the -r option.

       Each RC file is a sequence of Perl commands.  Naturally, a user can use
       this  in  creative  ways.   But  for  most  purposes, one simply uses a
       sequence of assignment statements that override some  of  the  built-in
       settings  of  Latexmk.   Straightforward  cases  can be handled without



                                19 January 2017                             20

       knowledge of the Perl language by using the examples in  this  document
       as templates.  Comment lines are introduced by the "#" character.

       Note  that  command  line options are obeyed in the order in which they
       are written; thus any RC file specified on the command line with the -r
       option  can  override  previous options but can be itself overridden by
       later options on the command line.  There is also the -e option,  which
       allows initialization code to be specified in latexmk's command line.

         For  possible  examples  of code for in an RC file, see the directory
       example_rcfiles in the distribution of latexmk  (e.g.,  at  http://mir-
       ror.ctan.org/support/latexmk/example_rcfiles).


HOW TO SET VARIABLES IN INITIALIZATION FILES
       The  important  variables  that  can be configured are described in the
       section "List  of  configuration  variables  usable  in  initialization
       files".  Syntax for setting these variables is of the following forms:

                           $bibtex = 'bibtex %O %B';

       for the setting of a string variable,

                           $preview_mode = 1;

       for the setting of a numeric variable, and

                           @default_files = ('paper', 'paper1');

       for  the  setting  of an array of strings.  It is possible to append an
       item to an array variable as follows:

                           push @default_files, 'paper2';

       Note that simple "scalar" variables have names  that  begin  with  a  $
       character and array variables have names that begin with a @ character.
       Each statement ends with a semicolon.

       Strings should be enclosed in single quotes.   (You  could  use  double
       quotes,  as  in many programming languages.  But then the Perl program-
       ming language brings into play some  special  rules  for  interpolating
       variables  into  strings.  People not fluent in Perl will want to avoid
       these complications.)

       You can do much more complicated things, but for this you will need  to
       consult a manual for the Perl programming language.




FORMAT OF COMMAND SPECIFICATIONS
       Some  of  the variables set the commands that latexmk uses for carrying
       out its work, for example to generate a dvi file from a tex file or  to
       view a postscript file.  This section describes some important features



                                19 January 2017                             21





LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


       of how the commands are specified.  (Note that some of  the  possibili-
       ties listed here do not apply to the $kpsewhich variable; see its docu-
       mentation.)

       Placeholders:  Supposed you wanted latexmk to use the command elatex in
       place  of  the  regular  latex  command,  and suppose moreover that you
       wanted to give it the option "--shell-escape".  You could  do  this  by
       the following setting:

            $latex = 'elatex --shell-escape %O %S';

       The  two  items  starting with the % character are placeholders.  These
       are substituted by appropriate values before the command is run.   Thus
       %S  will be replaced by the source file that elatex will be applied to,
       and %O will be replaced by any options that latexmk has decided to  use
       for this command.  (E.g., if you used the -silent option in the invoca-
       tion of latexmk,  it results in the replacement  of  %O  by  "-interac-
       tion=batchmode".)

       The available placeholders are:

       %B     base  of  filename  for  current command.  E.g., if a postscript
              file document.ps is being made from the dvi  file  document.dvi,
              then the basename is document.

       %D     destination  file  (e.g.,  the  name of the postscript file when
              converting a dvi file to postscript).

       %O     options

       %R     root filename.  This is the base name for the main tex file.

       %S     source file (e.g., the name of the dvi file  when  converting  a
              dvi file to ps).

       %T     The name of the primary tex file.

       %Y     Name of directory for auxiliary output files (see the configura-
              tion variable $aux_dir).  A directory separation character ('/')
              is appended if $aux_dir is non-empty and does not end in a suit-
              able character, with suitable characters being those appropriate
              to  UNIX  and MS-Windows, i.e., ':', '/' and '\'.   Note that if
              after initialization,  $out_dir is set, but $aux_dir is not  set
              (i.e.,  it  is  blank),  then  latexmk sets $aux_dir to the same
              value $out_dir.

       %Z     Name of directory for output files (see the configuration  vari-
              able  $out_dir).   A  directory  separation  character  ('/') is
              appended if $out_dir is non-empty and does not end in a suitable
              character,  with  suitable characters being those appropriate to
              UNIX and MS-Windows, i.e., ':', '/' and '\'.

       If for some reason you need a literal % character in  your  string  not
       subject to the above rules, use "%%".



                                19 January 2017                             22





LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


       Appropriate  quoting  will be applied to the filename substitutions, so
       you mustn't supply them yourself even if the names of your  files  have
       spaces in them.  (But if your TeX filenames have spaces in them, beware
       that many versions of the TeX program cannot correctly handle filenames
       containing  spaces.)  In case latexmk's quoting does not work correctly
       on your system, you can turn it off -- see the  documentation  for  the
       variable $quote_filenames.

       The  distinction  between %B and %R needs a bit of care, since they are
       often the same, but not always.  For example on a simple document,  the
       basename of a bibtex run is the same as for the texfile.  But in a doc-
       ument with several bibliographies, the bibliography files will  have  a
       variety  of  names.   Since  bibtex is invoked with the basename of the
       bibliography file, the setting for the bibtex command should  therefore
       be

            $bibtex = 'bibtex %O %B';

       Generally,  you  should use %B rather than %R.  Similarly for most pur-
       poses, the name %T of the primary texfile is not a useful placeholder.

       See the default values in the section "List of configuration  variables
       usable in initialization files" for what is normally the most appropri-
       ate usage.

       If you omit to supply any placeholders whatever in the specification of
       a  command,  latexmk will supply what its author thinks are appropriate
       defaults.  This gives compatibility with configuration files for previ-
       ous versions of latexmk, which didn't use placeholders.

       "Detaching"  a  command: Normally when latexmk runs a command, it waits
       for the command to run to completion.  This is appropriate for commands
       like latex, of course.  But for previewers, the command should normally
       run detached, so that latexmk  gets  the  previewer  running  and  then
       returns to its next task (or exits if there is nothing else to do).  To
       achieve this effect of detaching a command, you  need  to  precede  the
       command name with "start ", as in

            $dvi_previewer = 'start xdvi %O %S';

       This  will  be translated to whatever is appropriate for your operating
       system.

       Notes: (1) In some circumstances, latexmk will  always  run  a  command
       detached.  This is the case for a previewer in preview continuous mode,
       since otherwise previewing continuously makes no sense.  (2) This  pre-
       cludes  the  possibility  of running a command named start.  (3) If the
       word start occurs more than  once  at  the  beginning  of  the  command
       string,  that is equivalent to having just one.  (4) Under cygwin, some
       complications happen, since cygwin amounts to a complicated merging  of
       UNIX  and  MS-Windows.   See  the  source code for how I've handled the
       problem.

       Command names containing spaces: Under MS-Windows it is common that the



                                19 January 2017                             23





LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


       name of a command includes spaces, since software is often installed in
       a subdirectory of "C:\Program Files".  Such  command  names  should  be
       enclosed in double quotes, as in

            $lpr_pdf  =  '"c:/Program  Files/Ghostgum/gsview/gsview32.exe"  /p
       %S';
            $pdf_previewer   =   'start   "c:/Program   Files/SumatraPDF/Suma-
       traPDF.exe" %O %S';
            $pdf_previewer  =  'start "c:/Program Files/SumatraPDF (x86)/Suma-
       traPDF.exe" %O %S';


       (Note about the above example: Under  MS-Windows  forward  slashes  are
       equivalent to backslashes in a filename under almost all circumstances,
       provided that the filename is inside double quotes.  It  is  easier  to
       use forward slashes in examples like the one above, since then one does
       not have to worry about the rules for dealing with forward  slashes  in
       strings in the Perl language.)

       Command  names  under  Cygwin: If latexmk is executed by Cygwin's Perl,
       be particularly certain that pathnames in commands have forward slashes
       not  the  usual  backslashes  for the separator of pathname components.
       See the above examples.  Backslashes often get  misinterpreted  by  the
       Unix shell used by Cygwin's Perl to execute external commands.  Forward
       slashes don't suffer from this problem, and (when quoted, as above) are
       equally acceptable to MS-Windows.

       Using  MS-Windows  file  associations: A useful trick under modern ver-
       sions of MS-Windows (e.g., WinXP) is to use just the command 'start' by
       itself:

            $dvi_previewer = 'start %S';

       Under MS-Windows, this will cause to be run whatever program the system
       has associated with dvi files.  (The  same  applies  for  a  postscript
       viewer and a pdf viewer.)  But note that this trick is not always suit-
       able for the pdf previwer, if your system has acroread for the  default
       pdf viewer.  As explained elsewhere, acroread under MS-Windows does not
       work well with latex and latexmk, because acroread locks the pdf file.

       Not using a certain command: If a command is not to be run, the command
       name NONE is used, as in

            $lpr  = 'NONE lpr';

       This  typically  is  used when an appropriate command does not exist on
       your system.  The string after the "NONE" is effectively a comment.

       Options to commands: Setting the name of a command can be used not only
       for changing the name of the command called, but also to add options to
       command.  Suppose you want latexmk to use latex  with  source  specials
       enabled.   Then  you  might use the following line in an initialization
       file:




                                19 January 2017                             24





LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


            $latex = 'latex --src-specials %O %S';

       Running a subroutine instead of an external command: Use  a  specifica-
       tion starting with "internal", as in

            $latex = 'internal mylatex %O %S';
            sub mylatex {
                my @args = @_;
                # Possible preprocessing here
                return system 'latex', @args;
            }

       For  some  of the more exotic possibilities that then become available,
       see the section  "ADVANCED  CONFIGURATION:  Some  extra  resources  and
       advanced  tricks". Also see some of the examples in the directory exam-
       ple_rcfiles in the latexmk distribution.

       Advanced tricks: Normally one specifies a single command for  the  com-
       mands  invoked  by  latexmk.   Naturally,  if there is some complicated
       additional processing you need to do in your special situation, you can
       write a script (or batch file) to do the processing, and then configure
       latexmk to use your script in place of the standard program.

       You can also use a Perl subroutine instead of a script  --  see  above.
       This is generally the most flexible and portable solution.

       It is also possible to configure latexmk to run multiple commands.  For
       example, if when running pdflatex to generate a pdf  file  from  a  tex
       file  you  need  to  run another program after pdflatex to perform some
       extra processing, you could do something like:

            $pdflatex = 'pdflatex --shell-escape  %O  %S;  pst2pdf_for_latexmk
       %B';

       This  definition  assumes  you  are  using  a  UNIX-like  system (which
       includes Linux and OS-X), so that the two commands to be run are  sepa-
       rated by the semicolon in the middle of the string.

       If you are using MS-Windows, you would replace the above line by

          $pdflatex = 'cmd /c pdflatex --shell-escape %O %S'
                      . '&& pst2pdf_for_latexmk %B';

       Here,  the  UNIX  command  separator ; is replaced by &&.  In addition,
       there is a problem that some versions of Perl on MS-Windows do not obey
       the  command separator; this problem is overcome by explicitly invoking
       the MS-Windows command-line processor cmd.exe.


LIST OF CONFIGURATION VARIABLES USABLE IN INITIALIZATION FILES
       Default values are indicated in brackets.

       $always_view_file_via_temporary [0]
              Whether ps and pdf files are initially to be made in a temporary



                                19 January 2017                             25





LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


              directory  and  then moved to the final location.  (This applies
              to dvips, dvipdf, and ps2pdf operations, and the filtering oper-
              ators  on  dvi  and  ps  files.   It does not apply to pdflatex,
              unfortunately, since pdflatex provides no way  of  specifying  a
              chosen name for the output file.)

              This use of a temporary file solves a problem that the making of
              these files can occupy a substantial time.  If a viewer (notably
              gv)  sees  that  the  file has changed, it may read the new file
              before the program writing the file has  not  yet  finished  its
              work, which  can cause havoc.

              See the $pvc_view_file_via_temporary variable for a setting that
              applies only if preview-continuous mode (-pvc option)  is  used.
              See $tmpdir for the setting of the directory where the temporary
              file is created.


       $auto_rc_use [1]
              Whether to automatically read the standard  initialization  (rc)
              files, which are the system RC file, the user's RC file, and the
              RC file in the current directory.  The command line option -norc
              can  be  used to turn this setting off.  Each RC file could also
              turn this setting off, i.e., it could set $auto_rc_use  to  zero
              to prevent automatic reading of the later RC files.

              This  variable does not affect the reading of RC files specified
              on the command line by the -r option.


       $aux_dir [""]
              The directory in which auxiliary files (aux, log, etc) are to be
              written  by  a  run of (pdf)latex.  If this variable is not set,
              but $out_dir is set, then $aux_dir is set to $out_dir, which  is
              the directory to which general output files are to be written.

              Important  note:   The  effect  of  $aux_dir,  if different from
              $out_dir, is achieved by giving (pdf)latex  the  -aux-directory.
              Currently  (Dec.  2011  and later) this only works on the MiKTeX
              version of (pdf)latex.

              See also the documentation of $out_dir for some complications on
              what directory names are suitable.

              If  you also use the -cd option, and $out_dir (or $aux_dir) con-
              tains a relative path, then the path is interpreted relative  to
              the document directory.


       $banner [0]
              If  nonzero, the banner message is printed across each page when
              converting the dvi file to postscript.   Without  modifying  the
              variable  $banner_message,  this is equivalent to specifying the
              -d option.



                                19 January 2017                             26





LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


              Note that if $banner is nonzero, the $postscript_mode is assumed
              and the postscript file is always generated, even if it is newer
              than the dvi file.

       $banner_intensity [0.95]
              Equivalent to the -bi option, this is a decimal number between 0
              and  1 that specifies how dark to print the banner message. 0 is
              black, 1 is white.  The default is just right if your toner car-
              tridge isn't running too low.

       $banner_message ["DRAFT"]
              The banner message to print across each page when converting the
              dvi file to postscript.  This is equivalent to the -bm option.

       $banner_scale [220.0]
              A decimal number that specifies how  large  the  banner  message
              will  be printed.  Experimentation is necessary to get the right
              scale for your message, as a rule of thumb the scale  should  be
              about  equal  to 1100 divided by the number of characters in the
              message.  The Default is just right for  5  character  messages.
              This is equivalent to the -bs option.

       @BIBINPUTS
              This  is  an array variable, now mostly obsolete, that specifies
              directories where  latexmk  should  look  for  .bib  files.   By
              default it is set from the BIBINPUTS environment variable of the
              operating system.  If that environment variable is  not  set,  a
              single  element list consisting of the current directory is set.
              The format of the directory names depends on your operating sys-
              tem, of course.  Examples for setting this variable are:

                      @BIBINPUTS = ( ".", "C:\\bibfiles" );
                      @BIBINPUTS = ( ".", "\\server\bibfiles" );
                      @BIBINPUTS = ( ".", "C:/bibfiles" );
                      @BIBINPUTS = ( ".", "//server/bibfiles" );
                      @BIBINPUTS = ( ".", "/usr/local/texmf/bibtex/bib" );

              Note  that  under  MS  Windows,  either a forward slash "/" or a
              backward slash "\" can be used to separate pathname  components,
              so  the  first  two  and the second two examples are equivalent.
              Each backward slash should be doubled to avoid running afoul  of
              Perl's rules for writing strings.

              Important note: This variable is now mostly obsolete in the cur-
              rent version of latexmk, since it has a better method of search-
              ing  for  files  using  the kpsewhich command.  However, if your
              system is an unusual one without the kpsewhich command, you  may
              need to set the variable @BIBINPUTS.

       $biber ["biber %O %S"]
              The biber processing program.

       $biber_silent_switch ["--onlylog"]
              Switch(es)  for the biber processing program when silent mode is



                                19 January 2017                             27





LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


              on.

       $bibtex ["bibtex %O %S"]
              The BibTeX processing program.

       $bibtex_silent_switch ["-terse"]
              Switch(es) for the BibTeX processing program when silent mode is
              on.

       $bibtex_use [1]
              Under what conditions to run bibtex or biber.  When latexmk dis-
              covers from the log file that one (or more)  bibtex/biber-gener-
              ated  bibliographies  are used, it can run bibtex or biber when-
              ever it appears necessary to regenerate  the  bbl  file(s)  from
              their source bib database file(s).

              But  sometimes,  the  bib file(s) are not available (e.g., for a
              document obtained from an external archive), but the  bbl  files
              are  provided.   In that case use of bibtex or biber will result
              in incorrect overwriting of the precious bbl files.   The  vari-
              able  $bibtex_use  controls  whether this happens.  Its possible
              values are: 0: never use BibTeX or biber.  1: only use bibtex or
              biber  if  the bib files exist.  2: run bibtex or biber whenever
              it appears necessary to update the bbl  files,  without  testing
              for the existence of the bib files.

       $cleanup_includes_cusdep_generated [0]
              If  nonzero,  specifies that cleanup also deletes files that are
              generated by custom dependencies.  (When doing a clean up, e.g.,
              by use of the -C option, custom dependencies are those listed in
              the .fdb_latexmk file from a previous run.)

       $cleanup_includes_generated [0]
              If nonzero, specifies that cleanup also deletes files  that  are
              detected  in log file as being generated (see the \openout lines
              in the log file).  It will also include files  made  from  these
              first generation generated files.

       $cleanup_mode [0]
              If  nonzero,  specifies  cleanup mode: 1 for full cleanup, 2 for
              cleanup except for dvi, ps and pdf files, 3 for  cleanup  except
              for  dep and aux files.  (There is also extra cleaning as speci-
              fied by  the  $clean_ext,  $clean_full_ext  and  @generated_exts
              variables.)

              This  variable  is  equivalent to specifying one of the -c or -C
              options.  But there should be no need to set this variable  from
              an RC file.

       $clean_ext [""]
              Extra  extensions of files for latexmk to remove when any of the
              clean-up options (-c or -C) is  selected.   The  value  of  this
              variable is a string containing the extensions separated by spa-
              ces.

              It is also possible to specify a more general pattern of file to
              be deleted, by using the place holder %R, as in commands, and it
              is also possible to use wildcards.  Thus setting

                 $clean_ext = "out %R-blx.bib %R-figures*.log";

              in an initialization file will imply that when a clean-up opera-
              tion  is  specified,  not  only  is  the  standard  set of files
              deleted, but also files of the form  FOO.out,  FOO-blx.bib,  and
              %R-figures*.log,  where  FOO stands for the basename of the file
              being processed (as in FOO.tex).


       $clean_full_ext [""]
              Extra extensions of files for latexmk  to  remove  when  the  -C
              option is selected, i.e., extensions of files to remove when the
              .dvi, etc files are to be cleaned-up.

              More general patterns are allowed, as for $clean_ext.


       $compiling_cmd  [undefined],  $failure_cmd  [undefined],   $success_cmd
       [undefined]

              These  variables  specify  commands that are executed at certain
              points of  compilations  during  preview-continuous  mode.   One
              motivation  for  their  existance  is to allow convenient visual
              indications of compilation status even when the window receiving
              the screen output of the compilation is hidden.

              The  commands  are  executed  at  the following points: $compil-
              ing_cmd at the start of compilation, $success_cmd at the end  of
              a  successful  compilation,  and  $failure_cmd  at the end of an
              unsuccessful compilation.  If any of above  variables  is  unde-
              fined  (the  default situation) or blank, then the corresponding
              command is not executed.

              An example of a typical setting of these variables is as follows

                  $compiling_cmd = "xdotool search  --name  \"%D\"  set_window
              --name \"%D compiling\"";
                  $success_cmd    =  "xdotool  search --name \"%D\" set_window
              --name \"%D OK\"";
                  $failure_cmd   = "xdotool search  --name  \"%D\"  set_window
              --name \"%D FAILURE\"";

              These  assume  that  the  program xdotool is installed, that the
              previewer is using an X-Window system for display, and that  the
              title  of the window contains the name of the displayed file, as
              it normally does.  When the commands are  executed,  the  place-
              holder  string  %D  is  replaced  by the name of the destination
              file, which is the previewed file.  The above commands result in
              an appropriate string being appended to the filename in the win-
              dow title: " compiling", " OK", or " FAILURE".



                                19 January 2017                             29

              Other placeholders that can be used are %S, %T, and %R, with  %S
              and  %T normally being identical. These can be useful for a com-
              mand changing the title of the edit window. The  visual  indica-
              tion  in a window title can useful, since the user does not have
              to keep shifting attention to the (possibly hidden)  compilation
              window to know the status of the compilation.


       @cus_dep_list [()]
              Custom dependency list -- see section on "Custom Dependencies".


       @default_excluded_files [()]
              When  latexmk  is invoked with no files specified on the command
              line, then, by default, it will process all files in the current
              directory with the extension .tex.  (In general, it will process
              the files specified in the @default_files variable.)

              But sometimes you want to exclude  particular  files  from  this
              default  list.   In that case you can specify the excluded files
              in the array @default_excluded_files.  For example if you wanted
              to  process  all  .tex  files  with the exception of common.tex,
              which is a not a standard alone LaTeX file but a file  input  by
              some or all of the others, you could do

                   @default_files = ("*.tex");

                   @default_excluded_files = ("common.tex");

              If you have a variable or large number of files to be processed,
              this method saves you from having to  list  them  in  detail  in
              @default_files  and  having  to  update  the list every time you
              change the set of files to be processed.

              Notes: 1. This variable has no effect except when no  files  are
              specified on the latexmk command line.  2. Wildcards are allowed
              in @default_excluded_files.


       @default_files [("*.tex")]
              Default list of files to be processed.

              If no filenames are specified on the command line, latexmk  pro-
              cesses  all  tex files specified in the @default_files variable,
              which by default is set to all tex files ("*.tex") in  the  cur-
              rent  directory.  This is a convenience: just run latexmk and it
              will process an appropriate set of  files.   But  sometimes  you
              want only some of these files to be processed.  In this case you
              can list the files to be processed by setting @default_files  in
              an  initialization  file (e.g., the file "latexmkrc" in the cur-
              rent directory).  Then if no files are specified on the  command
              line  then  the  files you specify by setting @default_files are
              processed.




                                19 January 2017                             30





LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


              Three examples:

                   @default_files = ("paper_current");

                   @default_files = ("paper1", "paper2.tex");

                   @default_files = ("*.tex", "*.dtx");

              Note that more than file may be  given,  and  that  the  default
              extension  is  ".tex".  Wild cards are allowed.  The parentheses
              are  because  @default_files  is  an  array  variable,  i.e.,  a
              sequence of filename specifications is possible.

              If  you want latexmk to process all .tex files with a few excep-
              tions, see the @default_excluded_files array variable.


       $dependents_phony [0]
              If a list of dependencies is output,  this  variable  determines
              whether  to include a phony target for each source file.  If you
              use the dependents list in a  Makefile,  the  dummy  rules  work
              around  errors  make  gives  if  you remove header files without
              updating the Makefile to match.

       $dependents_list [0]
              Whether to display a list(s) of dependencies at  the  end  of  a
              run.

       $deps_file ["-"]
              Name  of file to receive list(s) of dependencies at the end of a
              run, to be used if $dependesnt_list is set.  If the filename  is
              "-",  then  the dependency list is set to stdout (i.e., normally
              the screen).

       $do_cd [0]
              Whether to change working directory to the  directory  specified
              for  the  main  source  file  before processing it.  The default
              behavior is not to do this, which is the same as the behavior of
              latex  and  pdflatex  programs.  This variable is set by the -cd
              and -cd- options on latexmk's command line.

       $dvi_filter [empty]
              The dvi file filter to be run on the  newly  produced  dvi  file
              before  other  processing.   Equivalent  to  specifying  the -dF
              option.

       $dvi_mode [See below for default]
              If nonzero, generate a dvi version of the document.   Equivalent
              to the -dvi option.

              The  variable  $dvi_mode  defaults  to  0,  but  if  no explicit
              requests are made for other types  of  file  (postscript,  pdf),
              then  $dvi_mode will be set to 1.  In addition, if a request for
              a file for which a .dvi file is a prerequisite,  then  $dvi_mode



                                19 January 2017                             31





LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


              will be set to 1.

       $dvi_previewer ["start xdvi %O %S" under UNIX]
              The  command  to  invoke a dvi-previewer.  [Under MS-Windows the
              default is "start"; then latexmk arranges to use the  MS-Windows
              start  program,  which will cause to be run whatever command the
              system has associated with .dvi files.]

              Important note: Normally you will want to have a  previewer  run
              detached, so that latexmk doesn't wait for the previewer to ter-
              minate before continuing its work.  So normally you should  pre-
              fix  the  command  by  "start  ", which flags to latexmk that it
              should do the detaching of the  previewer  itself  (by  whatever
              method  is  appropriate to the operating system).  But sometimes
              letting latexmk do the detaching is not appropriate (for a vari-
              ety  of non-trivial reasons), so you should put the "start " bit
              in yourself, whenever it is needed.


       $dvi_previewer_landscape ["start xdvi %O %S"]
              The command to invoke a dvi-previewer in landscape mode.  [Under
              MS-Windows  the default is "start"; then latexmk arranges to use
              the MS-Windows start program, which will cause to be  run  what-
              ever command the system has associated with .dvi files.]


       $dvipdf ["dvipdf %O %S %D"]
              Command to convert dvi to pdf file.  A common reconfiguration is
              to use the dvipdfm command, which needs its arguments in a  dif-
              ferent order:

                   $dvipdf = "dvipdfm %O -o %D %S";

              WARNING:  The  default  dvipdf  script  generates pdf files with
              bitmapped fonts, which do not look good when viewed by acroread.
              That  script  should  be  modified to give dvips the options "-P
              pdf" to ensure that type 1 fonts are used in the pdf file.


       $dvipdf_silent_switch ["-q"]
              Switch(es) for dvipdf program when silent mode is on.

              N.B. The standard dvipdf program runs silently,  so  adding  the
              silent  switch has no effect, but is actually innocuous.  But if
              an alternative program is used, e.g., dvipdfmx, then the  silent
              switch  has  an  effect.   The  default  setting  is correct for
              dvipdfm and dvipdfmx.

       $dvips ["dvips %O -o %D %S"]
              The program to used as a filter to convert a .dvi file to a  .ps
              file.   If pdf is going to be generated from pdf, then the value
              of the $dvips_pdf_switch  variable  --  see  below  --  will  be
              included in the options substituted for "%O".

       $dvips_landscape ["dvips -tlandscape %O -o %D %S"]
              The  program to used as a filter to convert a .dvi file to a .ps
              file in landscape mode.

       $dvips_pdf_switch ["-P pdf"]
              Switch(es) for dvips program when pdf file is  to  be  generated
              from ps file.

       $dvips_silent_switch ["-q"]
              Switch(es) for dvips program when silent mode is on.

       $dvi_update_command [""]
              When  the  dvi  previewer is set to be updated by running a com-
              mand, this is the command that is run.  See the information  for
              the variable $dvi_update_method for further information, and see
              information on the variable $pdf_update_method  for  an  example
              for the analogous case of a pdf previewer.

       $dvi_update_method [2 under UNIX, 1 under MS-Windows]
              How  the  dvi  viewer  updates its display when the dvi file has
              changed.    The   values   here    apply    equally    to    the
              $pdf_update_method and to the $ps_update_method variables.
                  0 => update is automatic,
                  1=> manual update by user, which may only mean a mouse click
              on the viewer's window or may mean a more serious action.
                  2 => Send the  signal,  whose  number  is  in  the  variable
              $dvi_update_signal.   The  default  value under UNIX is suitable
              for xdvi.
                  3 => Viewer cannot do an update, because it locks the  file.
              (As with acroread under MS-Windows.)
                  4  => run a command to do the update.  The command is speci-
              fied by the variable $dvi_update_command.

              See information on the variable $pdf_update_method for an  exam-
              ple of updating by command.

       $dvi_update_signal  [Under  UNIX:  SIGUSR1, which is a system-dependent
       value]
              The number of the signal that is sent to the dvi viewer when  it
              is  updated  by  sending  a signal -- see the information on the
              variable $dvi_update_method.   The  default  value  is  the  one
              appropriate for xdvi on a UNIX system.

       $failure_cmd [undefined]
              See the documentation for $compiling_cmd.

       $fdb_ext ["fdb_latexmk"]
              The  extension  of the file which latexmk generates to contain a
              database of information on source files.  You will not  normally
              need to change this.

       $force_mode [0]
              If  nonzero, continue processing past minor latex errors includ-
              ing unrecognized cross references.  Equivalent to specifying the



                                19 January 2017                             33





LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


              -f option.

       @generated_exts  [(  aux  ,  bbl  , idx , ind , lof , lot , out , toc ,
       $fdb_ext )]
              This contains a list of extensions for files that are  generated
              during  a LaTeX run and that are read in by LaTeX in later runs,
              either directly or indirectly.

              This list has two uses: (a) to set  the  kinds  of  file  to  be
              deleted in a cleanup operation (with the -c, -C, -CA, -g and -gg
              options), and (b) in the determination of  whether  a  rerun  of
              (pdf)LaTeX is needed after a run that gives an error.

              (Normally, a change of a source file during a run should provoke
              a rerun.  This includes a file generated by LaTeX, e.g., an  aux
              file,  that is read in on subsequent runs.  But after a run that
              results in an error, a new run should occur until the  user  has
              made  a change in the files.  But the user may have corrected an
              error in a source .tex file during the run.  So latexmk needs to
              distinguish user-generated and automatically generated files; it
              determines the  automatically  generated  files  as  those  with
              extensions in the list in @generated_exts.)

              A  convenient way to add an extra extension to the list, without
              losing the already defined ones is to use a push command in  the
              line in an RC file.  E.g.,

                              push @generated_exts, "end";

              adds  the  extension  "end"  to the list of predefined generated
              extensions.  (This extension is used by the RevTeX package,  for
              example.)

       $go_mode [0]
              If  nonzero, process files regardless of timestamps, and is then
              equivalent to the -g option.

       %hash_calc_ignore_pattern
              !!!This variable is for experts only!!!

              The general rule latexmk uses for determining when an extra  run
              of  some  program  is needed is that one of the source files has
              changed.  But consider for example a latex package  that  causes
              an  encapsulated postscript file (an "eps" file) to be made that
              is to be read in on the next run.  The file contains  a  comment
              line  giving  its  creation  date and time.  On the next run the
              time changes, latex sees that the  eps  file  has  changed,  and
              therefore  reruns  latex.  This causes an infinite loop, that is
              only terminated because latexmk has a limit  on  the  number  of
              runs to guard against pathological situations.

              But the changing line has no real effect, since it is a comment.
              You can instruct latex to ignore the offending line as follows:

                 $hash_calc_ignore_pattern{'eps'} = '^%%CreationDate: ';

              This creates a rule for files with extension .eps about lines to
              ignore.   The left-hand side is a Perl idiom for setting an item
              in a hash.  Note that the file extension is specified without  a
              period.  The value, on the right-hand side, is a string contain-
              ing a regular expresssion.  (See documentation on Perl  for  how
              they  are  to be specified in general.)  This particular regular
              expression specifies that lines beginning with  "%%CreationDate:
              "  are  to  be  ignored  in deciding whether a file of the given
              extension .eps has changed.

              There is only one regular expression available for  each  exten-
              sion.   If you need more one pattern to specify lines to ignore,
              then you need to combine the  patterns  into  a  single  regular
              expression.   The simplest method is separate the different sim-
              ple patterns by a vertical bar character  (indicating  "alterna-
              tion" in the jargon of regular expressions).  For example,

                 $hash_calc_ignore_pattern{'eps'}      =     '^%%CreationDate:
              |^%%Title: ';

              causes  lines  starting  with  either  "^%%CreationDate:  "   or
              "^%%Title: " to be ignored.

              It  may happen that a pattern to be ignored is specified in, for
              example, in a system or user initialization file, and  you  wish
              to  remove  this  in a file that is read later.  To do this, you
              use Perl's delete function, e.g.,

                  delete $hash_calc_ignore_pattern{'eps'};


       $kpsewhich ["kpsewhich %S"]
              The program called to locate a source file when the  name  alone
              is  not  sufficient.  Most filenames used by latexmk have suffi-
              cient path information to be  found  directly.   But  sometimes,
              notably when a .bib or a .bst file is found from the log file of
              a bibtex or biber run, only the base name of the file is  known,
              but not its path. The program specified by $kpsewhich is used to
              find it.

              (For advanced users: Because  of  the  different  way  in  which
              latexmk  uses  the  command specified in $kpsewhich, some of the
              possibilities listed in the FORMAT OF COMMAND SPECIFICATIONS  do
              not apply.  The internal and start keywords are not available. A
              simple command specification with possible options and then "%S"
              is  all  that  is  guaranteed to work.  Note that for other com-
              mands, "%S" is substituted by a single source file. In contrast,
              for $kpsewhich, "%S" may be substituted by a long list of space-
              separated filenames, each of which is  quoted.   The  result  on
              STDOUT of running the command is then piped to latexmk.)

              See  also  the  @BIBINPUTS variable for another way that latexmk

              also uses to try to locate files; it applies only in the case of
              .bib files.


       $kpsewhich_show [0]
              Whether  to show diagnostics about invocations of kpsewhich: the
              command line use to invoke it and the results.   These  diagnos-
              tics  are shown if $kpsewhich_show is non-zero or if diagnostics
              mode is on.  (But in the second case, lots of other  diagnostics
              are  also  shown.)   Without  these diagnostics there is nothing
              visible in latexmk's screen output about  invocations  of  kpse-
              which.


       $landscape_mode [0]
              If nonzero, run in landscape mode, using the landscape mode pre-
              viewers and dvi to postscript converters.  Equivalent to the  -l
              option.  Normally not needed with current previewers.

       $latex ["latex %O %S"]
              The LaTeX processing program.  Note that as with other programs,
              you can use this variable not just to change  the  name  of  the
              program used, but also specify options to the program.  E.g.,

                                  $latex = "latex --src-specials";

       %latex_input_extensions
              This  variable specifies the extensions tried by latexmk when it
              finds that a LaTeX run resulted in an error that a file has  not
              been  found,  and  the file is given without an extension.  This
              typically happens when LaTeX commands of the  form  \input{file}
              or  \includegraphics{figure}, when the relevant source file does
              not exist.

              In this situation, latexmk searches for custom  dependencies  to
              make  the  missing  file(s),  but restricts it to the extensions
              specified by the variable %latex_input_extensions.  The  default
              extensions are 'tex' and 'eps'.

              (For  Perl experts: %latex_input_extensions is a hash whose keys
              are the extensions.  The values are  irrelevant.)   Two  subrou-
              tines  are  provided for manipulating this and the related vari-
              able     %pdflatex_input_extensions,      add_input_ext      and
              remove_input_ext.   They  are  used as in the following examples
              are possible lines in an initialization file:

                  remove_input_ext( 'latex', 'tex' );

              removes the extension 'tex' from latex_input_extensions

                  add_input_ext( 'latex', 'asdf' );

              add the extension 'asdf to  latex_input_extensions.   (Naturally
              with  such  an  extension,  you  should have made an appropriate

LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


              custom dependency for latexmk, and should  also  have  done  the
              appropriate  programming  in the LaTeX source file to enable the
              file to be read.  The standard extensions are handled  by  LaTeX
              and its graphics/graphicx packages.


       $latex_silent_switch ["-interaction=batchmode"]
              Switch(es)  for the LaTeX processing program when silent mode is
              on.

              If you use MikTeX, you may prefer the results if  you  configure
              the  options  to include -c-style-errors, e.g., by the following
              line in an initialization file

                $latex_silent_switch   =   "-interaction=batchmode   -c-style-
              errors";


       $lpr ["lpr %O %S" under UNIX/Linux, "NONE lpr" under MS-Windows]
              The command to print postscript files.

              Under  MS-Windows (unlike UNIX/Linux), there is no standard pro-
              gram for printing files.  But there are ways you can do it.  For
              example, if you have gsview installed, you could use it with the
              option "/p":

                  $lpr = '"c:/Program Files/Ghostgum/gsview/gsview32.exe" /p';

              If gsview is installed in a different directory, you  will  need
              to  make the appropriate change.  Note the combination of single
              and double quotes around the name.  The  single  quotes  specify
              that  this is a string to be assigned to the configuration vari-
              able $lpr.  The double quotes are part of the string  passed  to
              the  operating  system to get the command obeyed; this is neces-
              sary because one part of the command name ("Program Files") con-
              tains a space which would otherwise be misinterpreted.

       $lpr_dvi ["NONE lpr_dvi"]
              The printing program to print dvi files.

       $lpr_pdf ["NONE lpr_pdf"]
              The printing program to print pdf files.

              Under  MS-Windows  you  could  set  this to use gsview, if it is
              installed, e.g.,

                  $lpr = '"c:/Program Files/Ghostgum/gsview/gsview32.exe" /p';

              If gsview is installed in a different directory, you  will  need
              to  make  the appropriate change.  Note the double quotes around
              the name: this is necessary because one part of the command name
              ("Program Files") contains a space which would otherwise be mis-
              interpreted.

       $lualatex ["lualatex %O %S"]
              The LaTeX processing program that is to be used when the  luala-
              tex program is called for (e.g., by the option -lualatex.


       %lualatex_input_extensions
              This  variable specifies the extensions tried by latexmk when it
              finds that a lualatex run resulted in an error that a  file  has
              not  been  found,  and  the  file is given without an extension.
              This  typically  happens  when  LaTeX  commands  of   the   form
              \input{file}  or  \includegraphics{figure},  when  the  relevant
              source file does not exist.

              In this situation, latexmk searches for custom  dependencies  to
              make  the  missing  file(s),  but restricts it to the extensions
              specified  by  the  variable  %pdflatex_input_extensions.    The
              default extensions are 'tex', 'pdf', 'jpg, and 'png'.

              See details of the %latex_input_extensions for other information
              that equally applies to %lualatex_input_extensions.


       $lualatex_silent_switch ["-interaction=batchmode"]
              Switch(es) for the lualatex program (specified in  the  variable
              $lualatex) when silent mode is on.

              See  details  of  the $latex_silent_switch for other information
              that equally applies to $lualatex_silent_switch.


       $make ["make"]
              The make processing program.


       $makeindex ["makeindex %O -o %D %S"]
              The index processing program.

       $makeindex_silent_switch ["-q"]
              Switch(es) for the index processing program when silent mode  is
              on.

       $max_repeat [5]
              The  maximum  number  of  times  latexmk will run latex/pdflatex
              before deciding that there may be an infinite loop and  that  it
              needs to bail out, rather than rerunning latex/pdflatex again to
              resolve cross-references, etc.  The  default  value  covers  all
              normal cases.

              (Note  that  the  "etc"  covers  a lot of cases where one run of
              latex/pdflatex generates files to be read in on a later run.)

       $MSWin_back_slash [1]
              This configuration variable only has an effect when  latexmk  is
              running under MS-Windows.  It determines whether, when a command



                                19 January 2017                             38





LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


              is executed under MS-Windows, there should  be  substituted  "\"
              for  the  separator  character between components of a directory
              name.  Internally, latexmk uses "/" for the directory  separator
              character, which is the character used by Unix-like systems.

              For many programs under MS-Windows, both "\" and "/" are accept-
              able as the directory separator character.   But  some  programs
              only  accept  "\"  on  the  command line.  So for safety latexmk
              makes a translation, by default.  It is conceivable  that  under
              certain situations this is undesirable, so the configuration can
              be changed.  (A possible example might be when some of the soft-
              ware  is  implemented  using  Cygwin, which provides a Unix-like
              environment inside MS-Windows.)


       $new_viewer_always [0]
              This variable applies  to  latexmk  only  in  continuous-preview
              mode.  If $new_viewer_always is 0, latexmk will check for a pre-
              viously running previewer on the same file, and if one  is  run-
              ning  will  not  start a new one.  If $new_viewer_always is non-
              zero, this check will be skipped, and latexmk will behave as  if
              no viewer is running.


       $out_dir [""]
              If  non-blank,  this  variable  specifies the directory in which
              output files are to be written by a run of (pdf)latex.  See also
              the variable $aux_dir.

              The  effect  of  this  variable  (when non-blank) is achieved by
              using the -output-directory option of (pdf)latex.   This  exists
              in  the  usual  current (Dec. 2011 and later) implementations of
              TeX, i.e., MiKTeX and TeXLive. But it  may  not  be  present  in
              other versions.

              If  you also use the -cd option, and $out_dir (or $aux_dir) con-
              tains a relative path, then the path is interpreted relative  to
              the document directory.

              Commonly,  the  directory specified for output files is a subdi-
              rectory of the current working directory.  However, if you spec-
              ify  some  other  directory, e.g., "/tmp/foo" or "../output", be
              aware that this could cause problems, e.g.,  with  makeindex  or
              bibtex.   This  is because modern versions of these programs, by
              default, will refuse to work when they find that they are  asked
              to  write  to  a  file in a directory that appears not to be the
              current working directory or one of its subdirectories.  This is
              part  of  security  measures by the whole TeX system that try to
              prevent malicious or errant TeX documents from incorrectly mess-
              ing with a user's files.  If for $out_dir or $aux_dir you really
              do need to specify an absolute pathname (e.g., "/tmp/foo") or  a
              path (e.g., "../output") that includes a higher-level directory,
              and you need to use makeindex or bibtex, then you need  to  dis-
              able  the  security measures (and assume any risks).  One way of

              doing this is to temporarily set an operating system environment
              variable  openout_any  to  "a"  (as  in  "all"), to override the
              default "paranoid" setting.


       $pdf_mode [0]
              If zero, do NOT generate a pdf  version  of  the  document.   If
              equal  to 1, generate a pdf version of the document using pdfla-
              tex, using the command specified by the $pdflatex variable.   If
              equal  to  2, generate a pdf version of the document from the ps
              file, by using the command specified by  the  $ps2pdf  variable.
              If  equal  to 3, generate a pdf version of the document from the
              dvi file, by using the command specified by  the  $dvipdf  vari-
              able.   If  equal  to  4, generate a pdf version of the document
              using lualatex, using the command  specified  by  the  $lualatex
              variable.   If  equal  to  5, generate a pdf version (and an xdv
              version) of the document using xelatex, using the commands spec-
              ified by the $xelatex and xdvipdfmx variables.

              In  $pdf_mode=2,  it  is  ensured that dvi and ps files are also
              made.  In $pdf_mode=3, it is ensured that a  dvi  file  is  also
              made.



       $pdflatex ["pdflatex %O %S"]
              The  LaTeX processing program in a version that makes a pdf file
              instead of a dvi file.

              An example use of this variable is to add certain options to the
              command line for the program, e.g.,

                   $pdflatex = "pdflatex --shell-escape %O %S";

              (In  some  earlier  versions  of  latexmk,  you needed to use an
              assignment to $pdflatex to allow the use of lualatex or  xelatex
              instead of pdflatex.  There are now separate configuration vari-
              ables for the use of lualatex or  xelatex.   See  $lualatex  and
              $xelatex.)


       %pdflatex_input_extensions
              This  variable specifies the extensions tried by latexmk when it
              finds that a pdflatex run resulted in an error that a  file  has
              not  been  found,  and  the  file is given without an extension.
              This  typically  happens  when  LaTeX  commands  of   the   form
              \input{file}  or  \includegraphics{figure},  when  the  relevant
              source file does not exist.

              In this situation, latexmk searches for custom  dependencies  to
              make  the  missing  file(s),  but restricts it to the extensions
              specified  by  the  variable  %pdflatex_input_extensions.    The
              default extensions are 'tex', 'pdf', 'jpg, and 'png'.

              See details of the %latex_input_extensions for other information
              that equally applies to %pdflatex_input_extensions.


       $pdflatex_silent_switch ["-interaction=batchmode"]
              Switch(es) for the pdflatex program (specified in  the  variable
              $pdflatex) when silent mode is on.

              See  details  of  the $latex_silent_switch for other information
              that equally applies to $pdflatex_silent_switch.


       $pdf_previewer ["start acroread %O %S"]
              The command to invoke a pdf-previewer.

              On MS-Windows, the default is changed  to  "cmd  /c  start  """;
              under more recent versions of Windows, this will cause to be run
              whatever command the system has associated with .pdf files.  But
              this  may  be  undesirable if this association is to acroread --
              see the notes in the explanation of the -pvc option.]

              On OS-X the default is changed to "open %S",  which  results  in
              OS-X  starting up (and detaching) the viewer associated with the
              file.  By default, for pdf files this association is  to  OS-X's
              preview, which is quite satisfactory.

              WARNING:   Problem  under MS-Windows: if acroread is used as the
              pdf previewer, and it is actually viewing a pdf  file,  the  pdf
              file  cannot  be  updated.   Thus makes acroread a bad choice of
              previewer if you use latexmk's previous-continuous mode  (option
              -pvc)  under  MS-windows.   This  problem does not occur if, for
              example, SumatraPDF or gsview is used to view pdf files.

              Important note: Normally you will want to have a  previewer  run
              detached, so that latexmk doesn't wait for the previewer to ter-
              minate before continuing its work.  So normally you should  pre-
              fix  the  command  by  "start  ", which flags to latexmk that it
              should do the detaching of the  previewer  itself  (by  whatever
              method  is  appropriate to the operating system).  But sometimes
              letting latexmk do the detaching is not appropriate (for a vari-
              ety  of non-trivial reasons), so you should put the "start " bit
              in yourself, whenever it is needed.


       $pdf_update_command [""]
              When the pdf previewer is set to be updated by  running  a  com-
              mand,  this is the command that is run.  See the information for
              the variable $pdf_update_method.

       $pdf_update_method [1 under UNIX, 3 under MS-Windows]
              How the pdf viewer updates its display when  the  pdf  file  has
              changed.  See the information on the variable $dvi_update_method
              for the codes.  (Note that information needs be changed slightly
              so  that for the value 4, to run a command to do the update, the

LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


              command is specified by the  variable  $pdf_update_command,  and
              for  the  value  2,  to  specify update by signal, the signal is
              specified by $pdf_update_signal.)

              Note that acroread under MS-Windows (but not UNIX) locks the pdf
              file, so the default value is then 3.

              Arranging to use a command to get a previewer explicitly updated
              requires three variables to be set.  For example:

                  $pdf_previewer = "start xpdf -remote %R %O %S";
                  $pdf_update_method = 4;
                  $pdf_update_command = "xpdf -remote %R -reload";

              The first setting arranges for the xpdf program to  be  used  in
              its  "remote server mode", with the server name specified as the
              rootname of the TeX  file.   The  second  setting  arranges  for
              updating to be done in response to a command, and the third set-
              ting sets the update command.


       $pdf_update_signal [Under UNIX: SIGHUP,  which  is  a  system-dependent
       value]
              The  number of the signal that is sent to the pdf viewer when it
              is updated by sending a signal -- see  the  information  on  the
              variable  $pdf_update_method.   The  default  value  is  the one
              appropriate for gv on a UNIX system.

       $pid_position[1 under UNIX, -1 under MS-Windows]
              The variable $pid_position is used  to  specify  which  word  in
              lines  of  the output from $pscmd corresponds to the process ID.
              The first word in the line is numbered 0.  The default value  of
              1 (2nd word in line) is correct for Solaris 2.6, Linux, and OS-X
              with their default settings of $pscmd.

              Setting the variable to -1 is used to indicate  that  $pscmd  is
              not to be used.

       $postscript_mode [0]
              If  nonzero,  generate  a  postscript  version  of the document.
              Equivalent to the -ps option.

              If some other request is made for which  a  postscript  file  is
              needed, then $postscript_mode will be set to 1.

       $preview_continuous_mode [0]
              If  nonzero,  run a previewer to view the document, and continue
              running latexmk to keep .dvi up-to-date.  Equivalent to the -pvc
              option.   Which  previewer is run depends on the other settings,
              see the command line options -view=, and the variable $view.

       $preview_mode [0]
              If nonzero, run a previewer to preview the document.  Equivalent
              to  the -pv option.  Which previewer is run depends on the other



                                19 January 2017                             42





LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


              settings, see the command line options -view=, and the  variable
              $view.

       $printout_mode [0]
              If  nonzero,  print  the document using the command specified in
              the $lpr variable.  Equivalent to the -p option.  This is recom-
              mended  not to be set from an RC file, otherwise you could waste
              lots of paper.

       $print_type = ["auto"]
              Type of file  to  printout:  possibilities  are  "auto",  "dvi",
              "none", "pdf", or "ps".   See the option -print= for the meaning
              of the "auto" value.

       $pscmd Command used to get all the processes currently run by the user.
              The  -pvc  option  uses  the  command  specified by the variable
              $pscmd to determine if there is an  already  running  previewer,
              and  to  find  the process ID (needed if latexmk needs to signal
              the previewer about file changes).

              Each line of the output of this command is assumed to correspond
              to  one  process.   See  the  $pid_position variable for how the
              process number is determined.

              The default for pscmd is  "NONE"  under  MS-Windows  and  cygwin
              (i.e.,  the  command  is not used), "ps -ww -u $ENV{USER}" under
              OS-X, and "ps -f -u $ENV{USER}" under  other  operating  systems
              (including Linux).  In these specifications "$ENV{USER}" is sub-
              stituted by the username.

       $ps2pdf ["ps2pdf %O %S %D"]
              Command to convert ps to pdf file.

       $ps_filter [empty]
              The postscript file filter to be run on the newly produced post-
              script  file  before other processing.  Equivalent to specifying
              the -pF option.

       $ps_previewer ["start gv %O %S", but start %O %S under MS-Windows]
              The command to invoke a ps-previewer.  (The  default  under  MS-
              Windows  will  cause  to  be run whatever command the system has
              associated with .ps files.)

              Note that gv could be used with the -watch  option  updates  its
              display  whenever the postscript file changes, whereas ghostview
              does not.  However, different versions of gv have slightly  dif-
              ferent  ways  of  writing  this  option.  You can configure this
              variable appropriately.

              WARNING: Linux systems may have installed one (or more) versions
              of  gv  under  different  names, e.g., ggv, kghostview, etc, but
              perhaps not one actually called gv.

              Important note: Normally you will want to have a  previewer  run



                                19 January 2017                             43

              detached, so that latexmk doesn't wait for the previewer to ter-
              minate before continuing its work.  So normally you should  pre-
              fix  the  command  by  "start  ", which flags to latexmk that it
              should do the detaching of the  previewer  itself  (by  whatever
              method  is  appropriate to the operating system).  But sometimes
              letting latexmk do the detaching is not appropriate (for a vari-
              ety  of non-trivial reasons), so you should put the "start " bit
              in yourself, whenever it is needed.


       $ps_previewer_landscape ["start gv -swap %O %S", but start %O %S  under
       MS-Windows]
              The command to invoke a ps-previewer in landscape mode.

       $ps_update_command [""]
              When  the postscript previewer is set to be updated by running a
              command, this is the command that is run.  See  the  information
              for the variable $ps_update_method.

       $ps_update_method [0 under UNIX, 1 under MS-Windows]
              How  the  postscript viewer updates its display when the ps file
              has   changed.   See   the   information   on    the    variable
              $dvi_update_method  for the codes.  (Note that information needs
              be changed slightly so that for the value 4, to run a command to
              do  the  update,  the  command  is  specified  by  the  variable
              $ps_update_command, and for the value 2, to  specify  update  by
              signal, the signal is specified by $ps_update_signal.)


       $ps_update_signal  [Under  UNIX:  SIGHUP,  which  is a system-dependent
       value]
              The number of the signal that is sent to the pdf viewer when  it
              is  updated  by  sending a signal -- see $ps_update_method.  The
              default value is the one appropriate for gv on a UNIX system.


       $pvc_view_file_via_temporary [1]
              The same as $always_view_file_via_temporary, except that it only
              applies in preview-continuous mode (-pvc option).


       $quote_filenames [1]
              This specifies whether substitutions for placeholders in command
              specifications  (as  in  $pdflatex)  are  surrounded  by  double
              quotes.   If this variable is 1 (or any other value Perl regards
              as true), then quoting is done.  Otherwise quoting is omitted.

              The quoting method used by latexmk is tested to  work  correctly
              under  UNIX systems (including Linux and Mac OS-X) and under MS-
              Windows.  It allows the  use  of  filenames  containing  special
              characters,  notably  spaces.   (But  note that many versions of
              latex and pdflatex cannot correctly deal with  TeX  files  whose
              names  contain spaces.  Latexmk's quoting only ensures that such
              filenames are correctly  treated  by  the  operating  system  in



                                19 January 2017                             44





LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


              passing arguments to programs.)

       $recorder [1]
              Whether  to  use the -recorder option to latex and pdflatex. Use
              of this option results in a file of extension .fls containing  a
              list  of  the  files  that these programs have read and written.
              Latexmk will then use this file  to  improve  its  detection  of
              source  files and generated files after a run of latex or pdfla-
              tex.

              It is generally recommended to use this option (or to  configure
              the  $recorder  variable  to  be  on.)   But  it  only  works if
              (pdf)latex supports the -recorder option, which is true for most
              current implementations

              Note  about  the  name of the .fls file: Most implementations of
              (pdf)latex produce an .fls file with the same  basename  as  the
              main  document's LaTeX, e.g., for Document.tex, the .fls file is
              Document.fls.  However,  some  implementations  instead  produce
              files  named  for  the program, i.e., latex.fls or pdflatex.fls.
              In this second case, latexmk  copies  the  latex.fls  or  pdfla-
              tex.fls  to a file with the basename of the main LaTeX document,
              e.g., Document.fls.


       $search_path_separator [See below for default]
              The character separating paths in the environment variables TEX-
              INPUTS,  BIBINPUTS, and BSTINPUTS.  This variable is mainly used
              by latexmk when the -outdir, -output-directory, -auxdir,  and/or
              -aux-directory  options are used.  In that case latexmk needs to
              communicate  appropriately  modified  search  paths  to  bibtex,
              dvipdf, dvips, and (pdf)latex.

              [Comment  to technically savvy readers: (pdf)latex doesn't actu-
              ally need the modified search path.  But,  surprisingly,  dvipdf
              and  dvips do, because sometimes graphics files get generated in
              the output or aux directories.]

              The default under MSWin and Cygwin is ';'  and  under  UNIX-like
              operating  systems  (including Linux and OS-X) is ':'.  Normally
              the defaults give correct behavior.  But there can be  difficul-
              ties  if  your operating system is of one kind, but some of your
              software is running under an emulator  for  the  other  kind  of
              operating  system;  in that case you'll need to find out what is
              needed, and set $search_path_separator  explicitly.   (The  same
              goes,  of  course, for unusual operating systems that are not in
              the MSWin, Linux, OS-X, Unix collection.)


       $show_time [0]
              Whether to show CPU time used.






                                19 January 2017                             45





LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


       $silence_logfile_warnings [0]
              Whether after a run of (pdf)latex to summarize warnings  in  the
              log  file  about  undefined  citations  and references.  Setting
              $silence_logfile_warnings=0 gives the summary of warnings  (pro-
              vided  silent mode isn't also set), and this is useful to locate
              undefined citations and references without searching through the
              much  more  verbose log file or the screen output of (pdf)latex.
              But the summary can also be excessively annoying.   The  default
              is  not  to  give  these  warnings.   The  command  line options
              -silence_logfile_warning_list and -silence_logfile_warning_list-
              also set this variable.

              Note  that multiple occurrences for the same undefined object on
              the same page and same line will be compressed to a single warn-
              ing.


       $silent [0]
              Whether  to  run  silently.   Setting  $silent to 1 has the same
              effect as the -quiet of -silent options on the command line.


       $sleep_time [2]
              The time to sleep (in seconds) between checking for source  file
              changes when running with the -pvc option.  This is subject to a
              minimum of one second delay, except  that  zero  delay  is  also
              allowed.

              A  value  of  exactly 0 gives no delay, and typically results in
              100% CPU usage, which may not be desirable.

       $texfile_search [""]
              This is an obsolete variable,  replaced  by  the  @default_files
              variable.

              For   backward   compatibility,  if  you  choose  to  set  $tex-
              file_search, it is a string of  space-separated  filenames,  and
              then latexmk replaces @default_files with the filenames in $tex-
              file_search to which is added "*.tex".


       $success_cmd [undefined]
              See the documentation for $compiling_cmd.


       $tmpdir [See below for default]
              Directory to store temporary files  that  latexmk  may  generate
              while running.

              The  default  under  MSWindows  (including  cygwin),  is  to set
              $tmpdir to the value of the first of  whichever  of  the  system
              environment  variables  TMPDIR  or TEMP exists, otherwise to the
              current directory.  Under other operating systems  (expected  to
              be  UNIX/Linux, including OS-X), the default is the value of the

              system environment  variable  TMPDIR  if  it  exists,  otherwise
              "/tmp".

       $use_make_for_missing_files [0]
              Whether to use make to try and make files that are missing after
              a run of latex or pdflatex, and for which  a  custom  dependency
              has  not been found.  This is generally useful only when latexmk
              is used as part of a bigger project which is built by using  the
              make program.

              Note that once a missing file has been made, no further calls to
              make will be made on a subsequent run of latexmk to  update  the
              file.   Handling  this  problem is the job of a suitably defined
              Makefile.  See the section "USING latexmk WITH make" for how  to
              do  this.   The intent of calling make from latexmk is merely to
              detect dependencies.

       $view ["default"]
              Which kind of file is to be previewed if a  previewer  is  used.
              The  possible  values  are  "default",  "dvi", "ps", "pdf".  The
              value of "default" means that the "highest" of the kinds of file
              generated is to be used (among dvi, ps and pdf).


       $xdvipdfmx ["xdvipdfmx -o %D %O %S"]

              The  program  to  make a pdf file from an xdv file (used in con-
              junction with xelatex when $pdf_mode=5).


       $xdvipdfmx_silent_switch ["-q"]
              Switch(es) for the xdvipdfmx program when silent mode is on.


       $xelatex ["xelatex %O %S"]
              The LaTeX processing program of in a version that  makes  a  pdf
              file  instead  of a dvi file, when the xelatex program is called
              for.  See the documentation of the -xelatex option for some spe-
              cial properties of latexmk's use of xelatex.


       %xelatex_input_extensions
              This  variable specifies the extensions tried by latexmk when it
              finds that an xelatex run resulted in an error that a  file  has
              not  been  found,  and  the  file is given without an extension.
              This  typically  happens  when  LaTeX  commands  of   the   form
              \input{file}  or  \includegraphics{figure},  when  the  relevant
              source file does not exist.

              In this situation, latexmk searches for custom  dependencies  to
              make  the  missing  file(s),  but restricts it to the extensions
              specified  by  the  variable   %xelatex_input_extensions.    The
              default extensions are 'tex', 'pdf', 'jpg, and 'png'.

CUSTOM DEPENDENCIES
       In any RC file a set of custom dependencies can be set up to convert  a
       file with one extension to a file with another.  An example use of this
       would be to allow latexmk to convert a .fig file to .eps to be included
       in the .tex file.

       The  old  method  of configuring latexmk was to directly manipulate the
       @cus_dep_list array  that  contains  information  defining  the  custom
       dependencies.   This method still works.  But now there are subroutines
       that allow convenient manipulations  of  the  custom  dependency  list.
       These are

           add_cus_dep( fromextension, toextension, must, subroutine )
           remove_cus_dep( fromextension, toextension )
           show_cus_dep()

       The custom dependency is a list of rules, each of which is specified as
       follow:

       from extension:
              The extension of the file we are converting from  (e.g.  "fig").
              It is specified without a period.

       to extension:
              The extension of the file we are converting to (e.g. "eps").  It
              is specified without a period.

       must:  If non-zero, the file from which we are converting  must  exist,
              if  it doesn't exist latexmk will give an error message and exit
              unless the -f option is specified.  If must is zero and the file
              we are converting from doesn't exist, then no action is taken.

       function:
              The  name  of the subroutine that latexmk should call to perform
              the file conversion.  The first argument to  the  subroutine  is
              the base name of the file to be converted without any extension.
              The subroutines are declared in the syntax of Perl.   The  func-
              tion  should  return 0 if it was successful and a nonzero number
              if it failed.




                                19 January 2017                             48





LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


       A custom dependency rule is invoked whenever latexmk detects that a run
       of  latex/pdflatex  needs  to  read a file, like a graphics file, whose
       extension is the to-extension of a  custom  dependency.   Then  latexmk
       examines  whether a file exists with the same name, but with the corre-
       sponding from-extension, as specified in  the  custom-dependency  rule.
       If  it  does, then the rule whenever the destination file (the one with
       the to-extension) is out-of-date  with  respect  to  the  corresponding
       source file.

       To  make the new destination file, the Perl subroutine specified in the
       rule is invoked, with an argument that is the base name of the files in
       question.   Simple cases just involve a subroutine invoking an external
       program; this can be done by following the  templates  below,  even  by
       those  without  knowledge of the Perl programming language.  Of course,
       experts could do something much more elaborate.

       One other item in each custom-dependency rule,  labeled  "must"  above,
       specifies  how the rule should be applied when the source file fails to
       exist.

       A simple and typical example of code in an initialization rcfile is

           add_cus_dep( 'fig', 'eps', 0, 'fig2eps' );
           sub fig2eps {
               return system( "fig2dev -Leps \"$_[0].fig\" \"$_[0].eps\"" );
           }

       The first line adds a custom  dependency  that  converts  a  file  with
       extension  "fig",  as  created  by the xfig program, to an encapsulated
       postscript file, with extension "eps".  The remaining  lines  define  a
       subroutine  that  carries out the conversion.  If a rule for converting
       "fig" to "eps" files already exists (e.g., from  a  previously  read-in
       initialization  file),  the latexmk will delete this rule before making
       the new one.

       Suppose latexmk is using this rule to convert a  file  "figure.fig"  to
       "figure.eps".   Then  it  will invoke the fig2eps subroutine defined in
       the above code with a single argument "figure", which is  the  basename
       of  each  of the files (possibly with a path component).  This argument
       is referred to by Perl as $_[0].  In the example above, the  subroutine
       uses the Perl command system to invoke the program fig2dev.  The double
       quotes around the string are a Perl idiom that signify that each string
       of  the  form  of a variable name, $_[0] in this case, is to be substi-
       tuted by its value.

       If the return value of the subroutine is non-zero,  then  latexmk  will
       assume  an  error  occurred during the execution of the subroutine.  In
       the above example, no explicit return value is given, and  instead  the
       return  value  is  the value returned by the last (and only) statement,
       i.e., the invocation of system, which returns the value 0 on success.

       If you use pdflatex instead of latex, then you will probably prefer  to
       convert  your  graphics  files  to  pdf format, in which case you would
       replace the above code in an initialization file by



                                19 January 2017                             49





LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


           add_cus_dep( 'fig', 'pdf, 0, 'fig2pdf' );
           sub fig2pdf {
               return system( "fig2dev -Lpdf \"$_[0].fig\" \"$_[0].pdf\"" );
           }

       Note 1: In the command lines given in the system commands in the  above
       examples,  double  quotes  have  been  inserted  around  the file names
       (implemented by '\"' in the Perl language).  They immunize the  running
       of  the  program  against  special characters in filenames.  Very often
       these quotes are not necessary, i.e., they can be omitted.  But  it  is
       normally safer to keep them in.  Even though the rules for quoting vary
       between operating systems, command  shells  and  individual  pieces  of
       software, the quotes in the above examples do not cause problems in the
       cases I have tested.

       Note 2: One case in which the quotes are important is  when  the  files
       are  in  a subdirectory and your operating system is Microsoft Windows.
       Then the separator character for directory components can be  either  a
       forward  slash  '/' or Microsoft's more usual backward slash '\'.  For-
       ward slashes are generated by latexmk,  to  maintain  its  sanity  from
       software  like  MiKTeX  that mixes both directory separators; but their
       correct use normally requires quoted filenames.  (See a log file from a
       run  of  MiKTeX  (at least in v. 2.9) for an example of the use of both
       directory separators.)

       If you have some general custom dependencies defined in the  system  or
       user  initialization  file,  you may find that for a particular project
       they are undesirable.  So you might want to delete the  unneeded  ones.
       For example, you remove any "fig" to "eps" rule by the line

           remove_cus_dep( 'fig', 'eps' );

       If  you  have  complicated sets of custom dependencies, you may want to
       get a listing of the custom dependencies.  This is done  by  using  the
       line

           show_cus_dep();

       in an initialization file.

       Another  example  of  a  custom  dependency  overcomes  a limitation of
       latexmk concerning index files.  The only index-file conversion  built-
       in to latexmk is from an ".idx" file written on one run of latex/pdfla-
       tex to an ".ind" file to be read in on a subsequent run.  But with  the
       index.sty package you can create extra indexes with extensions that you
       configure.  Latexmk does not know how to deduce the extensions from the
       information it has.  But you can easily write a custom dependency.  For
       example  if  your  latex  file   uses   the   command   "\newindex{spe-
       cial}{ndx}{nnd}{Special index}" you will need to convert files with the
       extension .ndx to .nnd.  The following lines in  an  initialization  RC
       file will cause this to happen:

           add_cus_dep('ndx', 'nnd', 0, 'makendx2nnd');
           sub makendx2nnd {



                                19 January 2017                             50





LATEXMK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LATEXMK(1)


               return system( "makeindex -o \"$_[0].nnd\" \"$_[0].ndx\"" );
           }

       Those  of  you with experience with Makefiles, will undoubtedly be con-
       cerned that the .ndx file is written during a run of latex/pdflatex and
       is  always  later than the .nnd last read in.  Thus the .nnd appears to
       be perpetually out-of-date.  This situation, of circular  dependencies,
       is endemic to latex, and latexmk in its current version works correctly
       with circular dependencies.  It examines the contents of the files  (by
       use  of an md5 checksum), and only does a remake when the file contents
       have actually changed.

       Of course if you choose to write random data to the .nnd (or  the  .aux
       file,  etc) that changes on each new run, then you will have a problem.
       For real experts: See the %hash_cal_ignore_pattern if you have to  deal
       with such problems.

       Glossaries can be dealt with similarly.



OLD METHOD OF DEFINING CUSTOM DEPENDENCIES
       In  previous  versions  of  latexmk, the only method of defining custom
       dependencies was to directly manipulate the table of  custom  dependen-
       cies.  This is contained in the @cus_dep_list array.  It is an array of
       strings, and each string in the array has four items in it, each  sepa-
       rated  by  a  space,  the  from-extension, the to-extension, the "must"
       item, and the name of the subroutine for the custom dependency.   These
       were all defined above.

       An example of the old method of defining custom dependencies is as fol-
       lows. It is the code in an RC file to ensure  automatic  conversion  of
       .fig files to .eps files:

           push @cus_dep_list, "fig eps 0 fig2eps";
           sub fig2eps {
               return system( "fig2dev -Lps \"$_[0].fig\" \"$_[0].eps\"" );
           }

       This  method  still  works, and is equivalent to the earlier code using
       the add_cus_dep subroutine, except that it doesn't delete any  previous
       custom-dependency  for  the  same  conversion.   So  the  new method is
       preferable.



ADVANCED CONFIGURATION: Some extra resources and advanced tricks
       For most purposes, simple configuration for latexmk along the lines  of
       the  examples  given  is  sufficient.  But sometimes you need something
       harder.  In this section, I indicate some extra possibilities.   Gener-
       ally  to  use  these, you need to be fluent in the Perl language, since
       this is what is used in the rc files.

   Variables and subroutines for processing a rule
       A step in the processing is called a rule. One possibility to implement
       the  processing  of a rule is by a Perl subroutine.  This is always the
       case for custom dependencies. Also, for any other rule, you can  use  a
       subroutine  by  prefixing the command specification by the word "inter-
       nal" -- see the section FORMAT OF COMMAND SPECIFICATIONS.

       When you use a subroutine for processing a rule, all the  possibilities
       of  Perl  programming  are  available, of course.  In addition, some of
       latexmk's internal variables and subroutines are available.   The  ones
       listed  below  are  intended  to  be available to (advanced) users, and
       their specifications will generally have stability under upgrades. Gen-
       erally,  the  variables  should be treated as read-only: Changing their
       values can have bad consequences, since it is liable  to  mess  up  the
       consistency of what latexmk is doing.


       $rule  This  variable  has  the  name of the rule, as known to latexmk.
              Note that the exact contents of this variable for a  given  rule
              may be dependent on the version of latexmk


       $$Psource
              This gives the name of the primary source file.  Note the double
              dollar signs.


       $$Pdest
              This gives the name of the main output file if  any.   Note  the
              double dollar signs.


       rdb_ensure_file( $rule, file )
              This  a subroutine that ensures that the given file is among the
              source files for the specified rule.  It is typically used when,
              during  the  processing of a rule, it is known that a particular
              extra file is among the dependencies that latexmk  should  know,
              but its default methods don't find the dependency. Almost always
              the first argument is the name of the rule currently being  pro-
              cessed, so it is then appropriate to specify it by $rule.

              For  examples of its use, see some of the files in the directory
              example_rcfiles of latexmk's distribution.  Currently the  cases
              that  use  this  subroutine  are exceltex_latexmkrc and texinfo-
              latexmkrc.  These illustrate typical cases where latexmk's  nor-
              mal processing fails to detect certain extra source files.


       rdb_remove_files( $rule, file, ... )
              This  subroutine  removes  one or more files from the dependency



                                19 January 2017                             52

              list for the given rule.


       rdb_list_source( $rule )
              This subroutine returns the list  of  source  files  (i.e.,  the
              dependency list) for the given rule.


       rdb_set_source( $rule, file, ... )
              rdb_set_source(  $rule, @files ) This subroutine sets the depen-
              dency list for the given rule to be the specified files.   Files
              that  are already in the list have unchanged information.  Files
              that were not in the list are added to it.  Files in the  previ-
              ous  dependency list that are not in the newly specified list of
              files are removed from the dependency list.



   Advanced configuration: Using latexmk with make
       This section is targeted only at advanced users who use the  make  pro-
       gram for complex projects, as for software development, with the depen-
       dencies specified by a Makefile.

       Now the basic task of latexmk is to run  the  appropriate  programs  to
       make  a  viewable version of a LaTeX document.  However, the usual make
       program is not suited to this purpose for at least two reasons.   First
       is that the use of LaTeX involves circular dependencies (e.g., via .aux
       files), and these cannot be handled by the standard make program.  Sec-
       ond  is  that  in  a  large document the set of source files can change
       quite frequently, particularly with included graphics  files;  in  this
       situation  keeping  a  Makefile  manually  updated is inappropriate and
       error-prone, especially when the dependencies can be  determined  auto-
       matically.  Latexmk solves both of these problems robustly.

       Thus  for  many  standard LaTeX documents latexmk can be used by itself
       without the make program.  In a complex project it simply needs  to  be
       suitably  configured.  A standard configuration would be to define cus-
       tom dependencies to make graphics files from their source files  (e.g.,
       as  created  by  the  xfig program).  Custom dependencies are latexmk's
       equivalent of pattern rules in Makefiles.

       Nevertheless there are projects for which a  Makefile  is  appropriate,
       and it is useful to know how to use latexmk from a Makefile.  A typical
       example would be to generate  documentation  for  a  software  project.
       Potentially  the interaction with the rest of the rules in the Makefile
       could be quite complicated, for example if some of the source files for
       a LaTeX document are generated by the project's software.

       In this section, I give a couple of examples of how latexmk can be use-
       fully invoked from a Makefile.  The examples use specific  features  of
       current  versions  of  GNU make, which is the default on both linux and
       OS-X systems.  They may need modifications for other versions of make.

       The simplest method is simply to delegate all  the  relevant  tasks  to

           .PHONY : FORCE_MAKE
           all : try.pdf
           %.pdf : %.tex FORCE_MAKE
               latexmk -pdf -dvi- -ps- $<

       (Note: the last line must be introduced by a tab for  the  Makefile  to
       function  correctly!)  Naturally, if making try.pdf from its associated
       LaTeX file try.tex were the only task to be performed, a direct use  of
       latexmk  without  a  Makefile would normally be better.  The benefit of
       using a Makefile for a LaTeX document would be  in  a  larger  project,
       where lines such as the above would be only be a small part of a larger
       Makefile.

       The above example has a pattern rule for making a .pdf file from a .tex
       file,  and it is defined to use latexmk in the obvious way.  There is a
       conventional  default  target  named  "all",  with  a  prerequisite  of
       try.pdf.   So  when  make is invoked, by default it makes try.pdf.  The
       only complication is  that  there  may  be  many  source  files  beyond
       try.tex, but these aren't specified in the Makefile, so changes in them
       will not by themselves cause latexmk to be invoked.  Instead, the  pat-
       tern  rule is equipped with a "phony" prerequisite FORCE_MAKE; this has
       the effect of causing the  rule  to  be  always  out-of-date,  so  that
       latexmk  is  always run.  It is latexmk that decides whether any action
       is needed, e.g., a rerun of pdflatex.  Effectively the  Makefile  dele-
       gates all decisions to latexmk, while make has no knowledge of the list
       of source files except for primary LaTeX file for  the   document.   If
       there  are,  for example, graphics files to be made, these must be made
       by custom dependencies configured in latexmk.

       But something better is needed  in  more  complicated  situations,  for
       example,  when  the  making  of graphics files needs to be specified by
       rules in the Makefile.  To do this, one can use  a  Makefile  like  the
       following:

            TARGETS = document1.pdf document2.pdf
            DEPS_DIR = .deps
            LATEXMK = latexmk -recorder -use-make -deps \
                  -e 'warn qq(In Makefile, turn off custom dependencies\n);' \
                  -e '@cus_dep_list = ();' \
                  -e 'show_cus_dep();'
            all : $(TARGETS)
            $(foreach file,$(TARGETS),$(eval -include $(DEPS_DIR)/$(file)P))
            $(DEPS_DIR) :
                   mkdir $@
            %.pdf : %.tex
                   if [ ! -e $(DEPS_DIR) ]; then mkdir $(DEPS_DIR); fi
                   $(LATEXMK) -pdf -dvi- -ps- -deps-out=$(DEPS_DIR)/$@P $<
            %.pdf : %.fig
                   fig2dev -Lpdf $< $@

       (Again,  the  lines  containing  the  commands  for the rules should be

       started with tabs.)  This example was inspired by how GNU automake han-
       dles automatic dependency tracking of C source files.

       After  each  run of latexmk, dependency information is put in a file in
       the .deps subdirectory.  The Makefile causes these dependency files  to
       be read by make, which now has the full dependency information for each
       target .pdf file.  To make things less trivial it  is  specificed  that
       two  files document1.pdf and document2.pdf are the targets.  The depen-
       dency files are .deps/document1.pdfP and .deps/document2.pdfP.

       There is now no need for the phony prerequisite for the  rule  to  make
       .pdf files from .tex files.  But I have added a rule to make .pdf files
       from .fig files produced by the xfig program; these are  commonly  used
       for  graphics  insertions  in  LaTeX documents.  Latexmk is arranged to
       output a dependency file after each run.  It  is  given  the  -recorder
       option, which improves its detection of files generated during a run of
       pdflatex; such files should not be in  the  dependency  list.   The  -e
       options  are  used to turn off all custom dependencies, and to document
       this.  Instead the -use-make is used to delegate the making of  missing
       files to make itself.

       Suppose  in  the LaTeX file there is a command \includegraphics{graph},
       and an xfig file "graph.fig" exists.  On a first run, pdflatex  reports
       a  missing  file, named "graph". Latexmk succeeds in making "graph.pdf"
       by calling "make graph.pdf", and after completion of its work, it lists
       "fig.pdf" among the dependents of the file latexmk is making.  Then let
       "fig.fig" be updated, and then let make be  run.   Make  first  remakes
       "fig.pdf", and only then reruns latexmk.

       Thus  we  now  have  a method by which all the subsidiary processing is
       delegated to make.

BUGS
       Sometimes a viewer (gv) tries to read an updated .ps or .pdf file after
       its  creation is started but before the file is complete.  Work around:
       manually refresh (or reopen) display.  Or use one of the other preview-
       ers and update methods.

       (The  following  isn't  really a bug, but concerns features of preview-
       ers.)  Preview continuous mode only works perfectly with  certain  pre-
       viewers:  Xdvi  on  UNIX/Linux  works  for dvi files.  Gv on UNIX/Linux
       works for both postscript and pdf.  Ghostview  on  UNIX/Linux  needs  a
       manual  update (reopen); it views postscript and pdf.  Gsview under MS-
       Windows works for both postscript and pdf, but only reads  the  updated
       file  when  its  screen  is refreshed.  Acroread under UNIX/Linux views
       pdf, but the file needs to be closed and reopened to  view  an  updated
       version.   Under  MS-Windows,  acroread locks its input file and so the
       pdf file cannot be updated.  (Remedy: configure latexmk  to  use  suma-
       trapdf instead.)
